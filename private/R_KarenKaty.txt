R_KarenKatyA:I might have to go to my computerQ:So one possibility also we have a dedicated phone for the project If you wanted to pull that up you could as well But if it would be easier to go on your phone you could do that too Because what we have this phone is dedicated and so we can actually have people text us things or do screenshots of different posts that they made And it just goes straight to our research account that wayA:Yeah Id probably have to go to my… I wonder if you can put a date inQ:Into FacebookA:YeahQ:Its kind of a pain but sometimes you can or sometimes you can go to images to your pictures and you can kind of click on a picture and that seems to help us getdo you have any other ideas Roth about how to get back _[00:01:05]A:I can do it on my big computer but…Q:YeahA:Im pretty sure Well let it search Anyway…Q:Okay Well let it search for a minute and then if it makes sense well go in there and do that So one of the things we do to keep everything confidential is have people give us a pseudonym so whatever name you want to be calledA:Kimberlys fineQ:Lets go something also with a KA:Karen Thats my sistersQ:All right Did that workA:NoQ:Okay A:Ill keep lookingQ:Okay A:While were talking keep goingQ:All right So we wanted to kind of start off and get a feeling for whathow did things progress in terms of before you were rescuedA:You mean before it floodedQ:Before it flooded like how diddid you know it was coming did youwas it a surprise how did that workA:Yeah we had called the Office of Emergency Management here When was that Sunday Yeah Sunday at like 1:30 in the morning And there was so much rain and they said No everythings great And we said You know were thinking maybe we should all leave and they said No were doing great We see the models because they had the Tax Day Flood They base everything on you know which is just stupid Everythings great Were doing fine We have plenty of room in the reservoir Everythings great and that was at 1:30 in the morning By 10:30 the next morning we couldnt get our cars out Q:Oh wowA:Yeah Thats what just… So that waswe knew after that we knew what was coming so we tried to tell all our neighbors Move everything you can and No… All the peoplesee what happens I think in flood situationsit happened in Katrina and it happened hereall our neighbors said the same thing Weve lived here forever Its fineQ:Yes rightA:They did it here And here we knew better We told everybody Yeah you lived here but look at all the houses that have been built Everythings built up now Theres not enough room for the water to go Youre gonna flood So we pulled everything upstairswasher dryer everythingexcept for the big couch and the appliances and things And they didn't and we told them and I think thats the devastation They cry every time they come backQ:I betA:They do So that was on Monday and then we made our neighbors come over and stay come upstairs with us And I guess we were lucky I mean even before we knew what was happening we had friends in Louisiana call and said Were gonna take off with our air boatsQ:Oh reallyA:Yeah Theyre gator hunters so they came from Homma Louisiana and drove all night and got us Tuesday around 12:00 And we had a couple neighbors with us and then… They walked through the water They got really nervous They thought this is the end Theres nobody coming to rescue us That was the thought even though we were like Its okay Our friends are gonna come and get you dont worry Or the Coast Guards nearby Its gonna be okay They all panicked They carried theirthese areshes 60-something Carried her big Bulldogshe just had heart surgerythrough the water like to here They walked all the way up to the front where the Coast Guard found them and got them all in So they were panlots of panic They were really panicked And we even triedwe sat on our porch and just yelled Just come over here Its okay and they were justyou could see the fear on their face and nobody wouldSo the next daywe watched the water rise at night and then the next daywe heard choppers and we heard the Coast Guard You heard the boats and we knew people were out and about and thats when we started getting Facebook posts Please help me lots of Stuck in my house Im trapped And I know the heliwe were watching the helicopters pull people out back there in the back I don't know how they saw them I know usually they tie something white on their…Q:SureA:So and it was the people in the neighborhood and the area just boat after boat after boat bringing people and all their anit was the animals People have so many animalsQ:Thats so trueA:I mean just I have three animals so they came with us but some people have like five dogs And it was crazy at thewhere the donut shop is down here at Mason Thats where everybody got left off Q:I was wondering how they came inA:Yeah You see the levys right hereQ:I didA:So if you go out make a left theres a donut shop on the left Everybody was in that parkingthere were people to carry you off of the boats There were people to carry your bags There were people waiting in trucks to take you wherever you wanted to go It was…Q:Wow Were those volunteers or were some of those Coast GuardA:No they were allno all volunteers The Coast Guard they had some Coast Guard going through yelling you know they do the marks and they yell And we had some friends that wouldnt leave My little boy his best friendwho lives right here across the parkthey lost his mom two weeks before the storm and so we couldnt get them to leave It was justhe wouldntthe dad wouldnt Hes like Im not leaving my house but there was nowhere for them to go I mean so we finallyour boat and got the Coast Guard to come over and we made them yell that he had to leave and we got them out And I don't know there was just lots of boats bringing peopleQ:Thats amazing and did they come from that directionA:Yeah they all came fromwell yeah because it was all blocked off all the way down here This was your onlythey had a big area that they put in the boats another area to get people out It was really niceQ:So weve interviewed some people who were over here in this neighborhood evacuating people and they said that there was like a makeshift boat ramp There was a you know theyA:Yeah everything Q:And it worked pretty well and people lined up and brought their boats inA:It was very organized Their brought your stuff to a certain area The only I guess they towe knew to cover everything in plastic bags so all the kids tookI said Pack anything that you think isyou dont want to lose and my daughter did a big backpack and they double-bagged it So when we got off everybody was being helpful grabbed all of our stuff Somebody else got my daughters everything that she held dear Q:Oh noA:Yeah but its okay But that was the only part that was a little frustrating to do that but we never had to call 9-1-1 We calledwe had a little bit of cell reception so IQ:You didA:Yeah it wasnt that great We didn't have TV We didn't have internet so we really didn't know what was going on but we were able to text our friends and though they didn't know what was going on because theyre in Louisiana we were able to communicate Come and get us So that part was good though we didn'tit would have been nice to have TV radio something That was hard We didn't know what was going onQ:So all that went downA:Yeah In fact when we got in a truck to take uswe got on 99 right here and theres people at the grocery store See I thought all of Katy was flooded We had no idea that you could go a mile and a half and… That was really weirdQ:That is WowA:Yeah I guess thats because Slidell when we flooded everybody flooded in our whole town So to see that it was only a little part was really weird and not having information I think if we had known that that would have been a little I don't know… Q:Thats helpful So your calls for help to your friends in Louisiana were through text messageA:YesQ:Did you have access to Facebook at all or any other social media Everything was text messageA:Yeah there was nono we couldnt get any kind of service like that We called I think my husband talked to his brother once or twice I don't think I called too many people because… But yeah it was texting I texted my friends because II still have the textsQ:That would be fabulous becauseA:That was just my sister I have a bunch of sistersQ:Do youA:I do Q:So texting is the main way you stay connectedA:Mm-hmm And we didn't think about calling 9-1-1 but we had hearwe knew that theres nothing you can do I mean unlessI mean I feel bad for the people who are… Lets see here it is Yeah I have a stepsister that lives down here so we were texting because she had a tornado in her neighborhoodQ:Wow Thats all pretty helpful to see the way that a conversation unfolds when people are really trying to get helpA:Like The street is floodedQ:So do you mind if I take screenshots and then I have you text them to our project phoneA:NoQ:So the way to do thatand Im certainly no pro at this but I thinkis it the same on a Samsung RothM:Im not sure Try itQ:Not Just a minute Would you Google it for meM:YeahQ:That would be great All right So text messaging lets pull that back up All right wonderful So a lot of times you can just screenshot it I can also take a picture with my cell phone if we can but… Oh and so that was the orange circle swirling around was that the tornadoM:Power button and home buttonA:Thats my sister talkingQ:Okay A:She was just watching the news I thinkQ:Let me try that power and home button Yeah Do you knowand then what we can do is we can take several screenshots and thenactually let me just take pictures I think thatll be easier in the grand scheme of things [Chit chat during taking screenshots omitted]Q:And this is a single sister just one sister thats in this conversationA:This is just one sister yeahQ:And she was the one that was having the tornadoesA:No this is my otherI have otherseven sistersQ:Do you reallyA:YeahQ:Wow thats pretty amazing Where did yall grow upA:All over I think thats the last oneQ:Okay A:Yeah thats were already outQ:Okay A:So that was it and I thinkQ:So youre already out at that pointA:Yeah I didnt text too muchQ:While you were waiting for help What about your friends in Louisiana that came to get youA:Yeah that was my husbandQ:Okay A:And I don'tthey didn't talk very much just…Q:They didn't They just came and got you and got outA:I can see if theres anythingQ:Thats pretty amazingA:Yeah thats all Oh wait is it Did I get rid of them all Oh I think yeah I thinkyeah that was the last picture so…Q:Was that when it was happeningA:That was after Oh yeah thats before Q:May Ido you mind opening that one and I can take a picture of that picture Because one of the things were noticing is that whenever itsA:Yeah thats before it floodedQ:Okay Thats actually really helpful Were trying to characterize what a before looks like right before and that seems to make a really big difference in people understanding that its legitimate Is that on your porchA:Yeah thats from our porchQ:Okay Wow So thats this area Thats just unbelievableA:Yeah I got rid of all hers Yeah SorryQ:Well weve heard about themA:Here my other sister maybeQ:Weve heard about those tornadoes so I know that they were not too far from here rightA:Yeah Okay Lets see that wasI don't even think I talked to her I think I just talked to my one sister and… Q:How many years did you live in LouisianaA:EightQ:Was Katrina the only hurricane you went throughA:No Ive lived in Florida We went through it all Weve been through Andrew and Ive been through every hurricane you can imagine Q:So do you feel like that gave you some knowledge about how to prepare and what was comingA:Yeah We were totally peacefulQ:WowA:Yeah Its just life Its just a hiccup Well be all right I don't see anyQ:Thats amazing A:When was the hurricane I don't rememberQ:The very end of AugustA:Here it is Mondays House is good Looks like were getting ready to floodQ:That would be interesting to see the flow of that YeahA:Oh my sister lives in Seattle Oh yeah I didnt want to talk to her because she was on a tripQ:Okay So what it looks like you might be doing there is kind of downplaying it evenA:Oh yeah She was having a good tripQ:May I take a picture of kind of that nature of that conversation That looksI could see myself doing something like that too but… Interesting I like the Don't worry about us kind of conversation Afterwards was she frustrated that you hadnt told her or wasA:Oh no see they live in Florida and whats the hurricane that cameErma Erma hit them so while they were in Alaska they were trying to get home and it hit while they were there So noQ:Did they have a lot of damageA:Just some And my dads there My sister you know my best friends there so no Hurricane Harvey was here and people knew it but then it was Erma and then it was Puerto Rico So this was old news so you know they were onto their thing so you know you dont like tothey have their own lives you knowQ:That isno that is rightA:That was itQ:What areas of Florida did they liveA:Theyre from Brevard County which is Melbourne Florida Space Coast Center Yeah were used to hurricanes but… Q:Thats just pretty amazing So what was different about this one about the way things were communicated from your experience in KatrinaA:Well Katrina we didn't really stay because I wasI had a baby on the way and I wasstartedwe just wanted to get out because I was starting to have contractionsQ:Oh goshA:So we made it to Florida and I had a baby over there So Louisiana people just know I don't know how to explain it you just know And its always been communicatedat least in our townget out because youre not gonna get help They communicate that very well in Slidell Get out youre not gonna get help We wont get to you And theyre pretty clear about that So I think people hear that and they go Now I know New Orleans they didn't do that and look at the problems but what I heard was Get out were not gonna be able to help you and they say that over and over again People just don't listen to that And even our neighbor across the street in Slidell hes lived there all his life He said Im gonna sit it through When we came back he said If I see its out in the Atlantic Im gone Ill never do that again He learned his lesson It was a hard hurricane to be in to see the water coming soa wave you know I think that was really hard for themSo it was different I mean Slidell everything got ruined There wasnt anybody to work the gas stations to work the Home Depots There wasnt anybody to have anything open so if you wanted anything for your house you had to drive an hour away Where here you can go right down the street to Home Depot so that was a you know but the 9-1-1 stuff I don't think anybody can get to you I mean I think people realize that now Maybe they don't I don't know I think its the people that have lived here all their lives and say Nothings gonna happen Theyre the ones that are gonna be calling 9-1-1 Q:Yeah but youve been through this and you know that there are limits to those resources What did you see that didn't work well in terms of communicationA:The OEM They should have saidtheres elderly in here They should have communicated You know what theres a lot of rain Just get out to be on the safe side to communicate that to the people They would have left I think if they would have heard that You know Were strongly advising people just move yoursave your cars And you know lets take these couples for an example They were stuck in their house They didn't call 9-1-1 even though theyre 60-something years old They didn'tnobody called 9-1-1 They got their stuff on their backs and walked out Nobody called 9-1I mean you know that was their mentalityQ:Yeah Had you heard that it was working or down or just people not even mention 9-1-1A:Nobody I know mentioned it But thendid we heard something Something aboutI guess that was after we got out we heard Don't bother calling 9-1-1 Its just a busy signalQ:Wow interesting So one of the things that were also curious aboutand especially since you mainly used your mobile phone for communicating it sounds like with friends and familyso theres these various capabilities that we have in our research literature of why people use mobile technology and Im really curious was it important for you to be locatable during the rescue and do you think that was important for the people who rescued youA:Yeah I mean they had the address and they had a map Though the roads were gone they were still able to find our houseQ:Okay A:So I think that was important Q:Thats interesting What about for you to be able to be reached and available for communication was that something that was important for you and the people rescuing youA:Yeah Q:What aboutand I don't know maybe for you multimedia capability I don't know the fact that you could take pictures that you couldA:Yeah that was goodQ:That was good okay Because one of the other things that we could do is I could just leave you with our dedicated project email and text and when you are on your computer if you would grab a few of those images and send them to us it would be great Theyll come straight into our project What about portability the fact you can move your device around with youA:Oh yeah I mean…Q:And then what about visibility Now visibilitys a little different A lot of times were talking about the fact that its out there where other people could see Usually thats related to social media but do you feel like that was important for you or not so muchA:No not at allQ:Okay All right What aboutA:You mean like putting things on FacebookQ:YeahA:Im not a FacebookI have one but yeah no Im not a…Q:What about persistence the fact that things are still out there and they still exist is that something thats importantA:What do you meanQ:That images still exist thatA:ImagesQ:We still have of the rescues ofA:Oh you mean like the pictures on my phoneQ:YeahA:Not to meQ:Not to you thats great Okay thats helpful A:But Im not a…Q:Thats right and that helps But whats great is that we have a mix of people that are either like they live and breathe social media to they don't use it at all and it actually helps us get a better understanding to have that mix Probably also not necessarily all that important is editability whether you could change and edit information because you really werent using social media muchA:NoQ:What about association did that matter the fact that you were affiliated with any groups Were you a part of a neighborhood group hereA:Yeah I think being a part of First Baptist Church Slidell our old church we knewwe had a group even before we flooded that were planning on coming over here to gut our house so yeah we had a greatQ:A great support system I tell you it really matters I remember when they came to rescue us and it made such a big differenceA:YeahQ:So the last couple of things I do is were trying to show the mix of people that we have that weve interviewed So if you wouldnt mind I have just four demographic questions and Ill just let you check those And then the last question I always ask people is is there anything that we havent asked that you think would be important or helpful for us trying to figure out what these real calls for help in rescues look likeA:I think one of the problems here in this neighborhood we live in one of the most diverse…Q:Oh do youA:Theres 95 official languages here in KatyQ:I didnt realize thatA:Yeah and if you look at our neighborhood we have _[00:27:08] from Iran We have Indian Muslim theyre from Bosnia Theyre from Columbia Every house is different And I don't know how that transpires Im a white English person so if I was to call 9-1-1 itd be much easier I don't know how the groups themselvestons of Nigerians in here how they deal with things like that Q:Thats interesting I might want toI want to be sure that I get their views and perspectives because that could be a different situationA:Yeah I don't know if they knew I think because I live in America and Im comfortable with America I know who to call but I don't know if they do and so I don't know what they didQ:Wow thats reallythats helpfulA:I mean just if I was in Nigeria and there was an emergency howI don't know if I would know what to do and I don't know if they did how they got out I mean I saw all different nationalities there at the place but I don't know how they…Q:How they called for help or who rescued them or anything yeahA:I mean obviously somebody speaks English there but a lot of these people here do not speak English I mean the Chinese here only one person will speak English nobody else speaks English in the houseQ:WowA:Same with thetheres Hispanic people here that just one or two speak the English Nigerians theyre the same Q:YeahA:Yeah so…Q:Thats really interestingA:Yeah They don't speak any English at all so that would be interesting towhat do they doQ:That would be very…A:Did they just kind of go with the flowQ:Yeah I knowA:And some to be honest I mean if youre Chinese theyre tough cookies They just go So I don't know that was just…Q:Thats really helpful to know Well I really appreciate this so muchA:My pleasureQ:This is very very helpful And Im excited that theyEND OF RECORDING [00:29:18]
