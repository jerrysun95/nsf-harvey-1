FaithQ:That we really are interested in is capturing what images people took whenever they were talking about rescues and talking about  so in your case in particular I think its very interesting that you were thinking whether you should be rescued and also looking and watching what was going onA:Yeah we were watching people get rescued There were elders you know So right across the street from us big old National Guard truck comes in And theyre you know carrying stuff out But we you know like I said we were able to get out after like two days And obviously we were able to prepare for it So we had food and you know we had water and that sort of thing Of course by  well we knew to park with  our cars got flooded That was the first thing Our cars got flooded the first time and that was  we were without cars forever So we knew the storm was coming And my daughter actually who lives with us has a boyfriend who lives a little bit on higher ground and there were ditches around We should park our cars over here So we thought  so we did that right before So we were without cars for quite a few days And then finally we went to go check on our cars My daughter actually stayed with her boyfriend during the storm So she was reporting to us letting us know Cars are still good No flooding Because we were freaking out So  but yeah go ahead I can ramble onQ:Yeah thats pretty amazingA:I want to just give you information So we were in the house for probably about a week straight Because we were still concerned about the reserve Because we were told we were going to be affected And actually our neighborhood was affected but it was half of itQ:Yes yes Was it in KatyA:No were in Houston Were right off of Highway 6 Right where North Eldridge is Where they got the big  yeah So we sit on our balcony and watched You know police racing toward it because they knew it was coming And so it was almost like you know a big  I dont know I want to say like a tidal wave coming and everybody racing to get these people before it happens And were seeing boats and you know all kind of stuff  the helicopters It was like a war zone And then a big Army plane flew over And we were like  and it was so low And it was huge And my husbands like I think theyre getting ready to jump out of the airplane and rescue people Thats what we thought But come to find out they were providing fuel for the helicopter or something is what I was told So yeah it was crazy It was like a war zone I mean we were Q:So did you  so you watched them evacuate people especially people who were elderly or sick and things like that Did you ever report anybody who needed to be rescued or A:No because we didnt know We couldnt get out of our house Yeah I mean we were on Facebook So of course people in different areas  and there were people saying Hey my aunt and uncle live in this neighborhood I need rescue And then people would say Heres some numbers to call And you know so everybody was being real resourceful And I am part of a lot of the community neighborhood apps Or just on Facebook theres like Beg Barter and its for this area And a lot of people communicate on that you know Or Hey I have no food you know Can anybody help That kind of stuff And then people kind of jump in and help So its really nice And theyre really helpful you know when  like in this situation I actually  my neighbor told me about this  to come hereQ:Thats great And you didnt call 9-1-1 or anything did youA:No we didnt We thought about it and then we found out that 9-1-1 wasnt even answering the phone So  and we found that out on Facebook I am totally a social media person My husbands not But thats how I find out all the information Then Im like Guess what you know Or This is going on And Ill tell him you know But yeah we found that out on Facebook as well And like I said now I did  because they were posting for every  people who needed it the list of like the reserve and different people that were volunteering with boats and if you need to get rescued call this number Then they came out with an app that I actually downloaded just because Q:Did youA:Yeah I dont have it I took it off because obviously Q:Do you remember what it wasA:Oh God It  noQ:Was it Zello by chanceA:It might  that sounds familiarQ:Was it like a walkie-talkie appA:Yes thats it Thats it Yeah that was it Because I remember  because I wasnt even sure how to use it I was like This is kind of weird Yeah why would you set up a walkie-talkie app I mean that was just weirdQ:You know it was interesting It was evidently used all in this area and they were A:It was workingQ:They were pretty amazing what it didA:I mean I saw the walkie-talkie thing and I wouldve figured it out If I needed to figure that out to get rescued I would But I just had it on standby Because they were talking about it rising really high So we were like Man if it starts getting really high  because were on the  we had a second floor So our kitchen living room dining room was affected But we could live without that Because actually from the first flood somebody from my job had given me like two really cool like hot plate things that you can cook spaghetti or whatever you want And so we did have that And we were prepared I did a big box and got stuff out of my garage that we were going to need and had the flashlights and whatever Because we really thought we were going to be without electricity And so that was pretty cool that we werent And our cable  we have DirecTV and usually when theres wind it goes outQ:I know Thats so trueA:So I thought we were going to totally be without And I was like Please dont let the Internet go down you know Because thats my lifeline And it didnt so that was cool Now we did have a little bit of DirecTV  it did go in and out But for the most part werent going  sorry excuse my French  bat-shit crazy Because I mean when you get stuck in a small place and you cant do much but go to the bathroom and come out you know And then you have no TV and no Internet and youre looking at each other like  so we sat out on our balcony a lot so we could just see what was going on in our neighborhood And we watched  we had a really trippy night one night We were out on the balcony We watched people literally drive into the flood like maybe for insurance purposes Pull all the way up  because we have a little circle right at the end We watched a group of guys in a truck pull up to the deepest part of it open all the doors and get out and walk out And I looked at my husband and I was like Thats really weird What are they doing And then we started talking about it But like was it the next morning we got up and it was goneA2:The truck was gone the next morningA:Yeah it was really weird But the water was still thereA2:I think they were just trying to see if they could get through it And I yelled off the balcony Youre going to get stuck And he still drove and they got stuck and they had to  I mean the water was up their waistA:So the cars were in the middle of the road just kind of  but people are crazy Why would you even try Thats so stupidQ:So were kind of curious Since you sat out on your balcony did you take a lot of  did you take picturesA:Ive got pictures of thingsQ:Yeah One of the things that we have a dedicated phone Brett do you our A:For the picturesQ:For if people are willing to share pictures with usA:Now you know to me they just dont show the whole dramatic part of it But I mean you can get an idea Babe dont you have some too Ive got to find  OK So heres our house We have pictures of it  cleaning it out and all that good stuffQ:So we have anything that had to do with the rescue or the water rising Something like that is really helpfulA:I have us on the balcony taking pictures of outside water I didnt take pictures of anybody rescuing I did do that the first time Because the first time was our first flood So we were like Weve been through this Were professionals Because were from Maryland Were used to snow and ice you know We know how to do that We didnt know how to do the flood And we were like Oh my God The first time we were having a heart attack And it was dark That was the problem Lets seeQ:And we have noticed there is a difference there And one of the things that seems to work pretty well is if people do like screenshots where they  do you know how to do thatA:Mm-hmmQ2:Where you can text just the original picture as well Or we have AirDrop as well which may be quicker So it depends on your deviceA:I have that too I just never used it But  because Im so used to just texting everything you know Yeah or posting it to Facebook or whatever So let me see Ive got to go way back I take a lot of picturesA2:I dont have any picturesA:We do I do I have some I dont know if you know theyre going to be the wow factor that youre looking forQ:Were actually looking for realA:Oh its realQ:Thats kind of the main thing hereA:Yeah because I did  I was trying to show my family Because its kind of like Were sitting out here waiting Here comes the water And you know our next-door neighbor  Im getting there now Ive got pictures of my little mini fridge Thats what were living out of You know its like  and luckily we had that in the garage And we were able to bring that upstairsQ:And you moved it upstairsA:These are not us though These  I was getting pictures from other people tooQ:That would actually even be A:OK so I was copying  because I was like Wow because people were posting them on Facebook So whats the numberQ2:So Ill give you the number Here Actually I think  actually hit cancel real fast So hit that button iPhone and that should come right to meA:OK let me attach some more picturesQ2:Yeah feel free to click as many as you wantA:We do mobile detailing too and we did a couple molded carsQ:I bet you didA:And they were pretty interesting We had Q:This is that phone number just to make it things easierA:We  so do you want pictures of the house or noQ:I think thats greatA:Or would you rather just see the waterQ:Really not post But its more you know before  yeah thats helpfulA:Trash OK So you want to see the mold  major destruction or not so muchQ:Not so much its more the beforeA:OK I think I know what youre looking for yeah OK Not the cleanup part of itQ:Not the cleanup Thats rightA:OK And I didnt  we got a video of the  we got a video of the garage Because it was  did this weird pumpy thing Like so I took a video of it because it was like  I dont know Its weird It was like water was pumping out But I mean we had cement and the step I didnt understand why it was doing that OK heres  this is a good one All thatQ:Thats greatQ2:Yeah thats greatA:Yeah I did I got more Because once you could get outside and start taking pictures OK theres our house I just want to get them all in hereQ:Yeah that would be greatA:Lets see I have a lot of pictures of my house because I had to take pictures for insuranceQ:Of course Most people have those yeahA:Well we had homeowners insurance but we didnt have flood insurance So that sucked So we were able  because our roof got damaged and there was some water that came inside we were able to get insurance help that way which did helpQ:Yeah every little bitA:Heres all the donated stuff that we got Does that help Or no Do you not want thatQ:Thats not really my A:What youre looking for OK I just want to make sure OK here we go OK somebody posted that You might like that one Heres another oneQ2:Yeah thatd be greatA:Yeah Oh I got a picture of the helicopterQ:Thats great actuallyA:You want thatQ:Yeah I doA:I didnt even know I had thatQ:Ive heard about the helicoptersA:I tried to get the plane but it was so fast and I was in the bathroom And my husbands like Oh God theres a big Army plane flying over Well this is kind of when it was drying out I dont know if you want that You want the before huh I know you said that SorryQ:No I appreciate you askingA:OK heres where we start getting some water But see its hard to see But Ill give it to youQ:Yeah that  that gives us some ideasA:And Im kind of  I guess Im short because Im just noticing  OK heres a good one Thats underwaterQ:That is perfectA:And a big hole in the road This is a good one I dont know if you all have seen Houston where they have the graffiti on thereQ:Thats unrealA:Yeah that was crazy A bunch of cars underwaterQ:Yeah thats helpfulA:These are all that I got off of Facebook Now this is my neighborhood This is kind of how the rising water was This is that circle that I talked about that had all the water that they were driving in Our house is kind of right here But it ended up only  when they did the reserve it ended up only affecting that area So we were able to go around and kind of get out of the neighborhood thank God We werent stuck there for like a week or a month like they were talking about And thats what our fear was  that it was going to  well Ill send it to you and then you can pick through what you want And then heres where its  see its so dark you cant even  I dont know what I was doing All you can see is like a water reflection I had an older phone This is my new phone So it was horribleQ:Did it get ruinedA:This is my garage where things are floating aroundQ:That would be very helpful to see So you had to get a new phone alsoA:Mm-hmmQ:Thats  almost everybody weve talked to thats the caseA:I dont know It just started really whacking out on me OK heres a good one This is when we were sitting outside on the balconyQ:Oh very helpfulA:And thats my neighbors And to the right of us the neighbors car was flooding His car started just on its own beeping and like the wires and lights were going And I was like Is he in there Is he trying to move his car What is he doing So it did that for like that for like an hour That drove us crazyQ:Oh I betA:That was the car actually I guess I felt the need to take a picture of that because it was bothering me But all of these were yeah nighttime Because come nighttime we were bored And you know we were sitting on the balcony And that seemed to be when the action was going on tooQ:You know thats actually really helpful though Because we can tell a little bit And I have a feeling people are posting real pictures at night So for us to be able to see what they look like that would be greatA:Well this I was trying to show my family the water lineQ:Oh wow Thats so interestingA:But Ill give it to you that way you can pick through Oh this is when we were driving by And this was like a big field It was a soccer field covered in water Theres another night oneQ:Wow thats so amazingA:We were so boredQ:Well and that makes sense that you areA:Its kind of exciting at first you know and youre like Oh look at all this stuff thats happening And then after day two youre like OK this is boring I want to go to the store I want to get back to my normal life And you cant go anywhere This is us  we got the bright idea wed go spend $300 and sandbag And it didnt workQ:And it didnt workA:No So we spent $300  because we got flooded the first time Im like I just got my kitchen done Im not doing this And so I thought Maybe if we  because it really only at one time  well we did the front door too We did all the front door the back door and the garage OK I dont know how that happened Ill go  it doesnt  Ill probably have to go through the pictures again Let me just make sure  I dont have to go check pictures again Oh and then we also had a tornado that came throughQ:Oh gosh Thats helpful too Thats very helpful I did hear about that Id forgotten that happenedA:We had quite a few tornadoes coming through OK Im going to AirDrop now So Ive got two phones nowQ2:OK so try the A:The first one since that popped upQ2:Yep and then lets see if I get the message If not its the other oneA:Thats somebody Thats himQ:You have a bunch of pictures nowQ2:Im accepting them right nowA:You didnt have them before You have them nowQ2:Weve got them right here Thank youA: [00:16:09] AirDroppingA2:I didnt even know what that AirDrop wasQ:You know what I didnt either A friend of mine told me about itA:My daughter showed me But like I said I didnt  like I said youre just used to texting that Q:Thats usually what I doA:Nobodys usually sitting next to you that you  you knowQ:So the other thing we need to do is were trying to capture kind of the essence of the people that were interview So its just very basic demographics And its only with your pseudonymA:I gotcha Do you want me to or do you want toQ:You can fill that out You are welcome just to click thatA:Were just doing meQ:Yeah just do youA:Is this one the Q:YeahA:OK 44 And were going to do this one Is that how it worksQ:That is That is I think the only other question I have is  one of the things were fascinated by is when people have their mobile devices there are a bunch of different kind of features of the phone And were trying to figure out from your opinion which of those were most helpful either you know during what you saw people being rescued  and then do you think it was important for people who were doing the rescuingA:AbsolutelyQ:So locatability  the ability to be able to locate peopleA:Right Oh yeah that helped tremendously Facebook was awesomeQ:Isnt that amazingA:I was totally on Facebook And that was most of my  like I said the Beg Barters And people -- they created like Harvey rescue sites And thats what I was on as well and listening to the news in between Just trying to see whats getting ready to happen or what we need to do And so yeah so do you want to Q:And then reachability  for people being able to reach you Was that importantA:We didnt have an issue Its important Its definitely important because we were keeping contact We were in a group message I had a couple people from Maryland My mom my sister because my mom is in Cypress My sister is in Katy  Old Katy Their water came like right up to their garage but it didnt come inside So we were all reporting and Im like Oh well my waters inside now you know Im the one that got it again dammit So and then you know like I remember 3:00 in the morning getting a text through the group message A friend of ours in Maryland You know Whats going on now you know Are you all having to be rescued Get out She kept saying Get out Im watching the news Because she was in Maryland the news And were like Well at this point we didnt feel that we needed to because we were prepared luckily I dont think a lot of the elderlies were prepared and had family that came and assisted them So yeah but with the lists that people posted on the sites availability was Q:What about availability Was that importantA:Meaning were they available when we neededQ:Like the mobile phone knowing that you were available to be reached  was that importantA:Oh yes thats totally importantQ:And what about multimedia So pictures that kind of stuffA:Yes Oh yeah we were  I was texting Hey look where the water is nowQ:And what about portability  the fact that you could take it with you  your mobile phoneA:Oh yeah I cant live without my phone Its stuck to me Im like Wheres my phone Like everything I do on my phone I do all my computer stuff on my phone now I mean thats how awesome it isQ:Its pretty incredible isnt it What about visibility So in other words was that OKA:YeahQ:And then persistence  the fact that things exist beyond the dayA:I was totally amazed that there were actually people out there rescuing I mean I was like Wow whered all these people come from So that was coolQ:Did you ever find yourself using any kind of edit ability So actually what you showed me and drew A:Yeah I did a lot of that yeahQ:You drew that line on there And then association  the fact that people could see that you were associated with different groups Was that importantA:Oh yeah Im well known on that Because we do our business on there as well And we buy and sell And I mean theres just so much you can doQ:Thats pretty amazing So the last question I always ask people is: is there anything we havent asked you that you think might be helpful for our researchA:I think no I mean I think as far as the Internet and the apps and the  you know everybody coming together you know and being able to communicate through that Because God if youre just at home watching the news theres  you need to like contact people that are in other areas you know and know whats going on And you know a lot of people warned us OK everybody prepare Theyre getting ready to release Theres things that they werent really telling us on the news that people were finding out and knew about And so you know thats what I tell my husband Look we need to do this Theyre getting ready to do this you know Or just you know Hey my brother Bobs got a boat and hes rescuing people you know Call this number and well come get you right now Or where they were taking people That was another big thing I mean you know even though we didnt do it we wanted to know these things in case we had to And then of course as it started dying down who was coming through neighborhoods to deliver water Because we still werent able to get out But they were coming with big trucks to you know  yeah it helps it totally helps I mean I probably wouldve had a panic attack had I not known what was going on during the whole thing You know because of course like I said the news Theyre just  its just the drastic stuff you know And its not really right there in your neighborhood The real like you saidQ:The real Thats great Well this is incredibly helpful I appreciate it Lets be sure that we dont keep you too longA:Thats fine No problemQ:Im very appreciativeA:Hope it helpsEND OF RECORDING (00:21:50)11
