VR_MattMatt 1Q:Just fill me a little bit with how you got involved with the rescue effortA:So that week I was Denver Colorado and  at an offgrid in Denver so my cell phone was off as the storm hit I checked in to call my wife  she had flown to Atlanta and my flight got redirected to Atlanta from Denver So I ended up there And then I was sitting around  I think it was that Monday morning whatever that day was  my dad asked if I know of anyone who has a boat in Memorial Park I  it immediately hit me If my day is asking me that question whos from Atlanta and only knows one person that means theres probably 10000 people trapped So I had this old playbook  Im a maritime recruiter by trade which means I place people on ships for a living So I professionally place people on boats for a living which means I had like an old playbook from the PB oil spill that I used to help with the cleanup So what I did is I basically put a blast out through my network Ive got about 100000 followers and put a blast out through my network sayig Im helping on this If anyones trapped please contact me and give me your address And if you have a boat contact me And then Ill become the node connector at that point And so I pushed that out into my network and  probably had about 70 requests immediately And then I started getting work and sourced some boats and matchmaking boats to people And-Q:You were in DenverA:I was in Atlanta at this time yeah So all my stuff was cloud based All I could see was  give me a name number story Id call in You get a story  lady trapped in the Medical Center 9-1-1 is not answering the phone call Roofs collapsing with a pregnant lady Someone help So in the process in that you basically can take name story address  and then push that through the market So what happens is its what I call crowd source sort of funneling Which means you push it out and the market picks up on it And so the concept is  youd rather have 5 people show at a location than none And so when I started hearing rescuing happening through my network that means I knew it was working So you had control over kind of laser stuff and then you had control over just letting the network know kind of the way point or the coordinatesQ:So those 100000 followers  are you talking LinkedIn FacebookA:All of the aboveQ:Altogether just about 100000 Okay So where were you  did you set up like a platform online somewhere or just where did that take place  the coordinatingA:Primarily Facebook That was like the main hubQ:So you put out a call for boats Were you also dispatching Sounds like you were dispatching to direct address too rightA:CorrectQ:And that was done through Facebook as wellA:Primarily yeahQ:Just say  I know this person has a boat so youd message them directlyA:Correct And connect the two nodes and then on to the nextQ:Did you have any mapping ability Were you looking at a map and saying  Well I know John is over in this part and Bill is over hereA:Rough  kind of rough guesstimationQ:And were most of the people that responded just individuals with boats or-A:All the  yeah most of them So the blast was  I put it out I mean it was pretty bold but I basically said  Anyone in America if you have a boat right now and youre looking for adventure start heading to Houston And so  and so I did that And when I heard that 9-1-1 was getting a thousand calls an hour and wasnt answering any of them thats when I was like  Woah Ive got a process I can step in and do this And so when you click send in those situations its really interesting because you step into a different realm which is you actually put yourself into a ball of chaos Its a market that exists And so when you do that it was really  it was really interesting going into that because youre stepping into just a chaos pool at that point Organizing chaos is one of my specialties Its just what I do for a livingQ:From the recruiting side of itA:Yeah Its an art formQ:Because theyre way more applicants than there are positions Whats the- Like whats the parallelA:Its just  theres always  theres moving parts Look at it like this So I played linebacker in college So I basically trained my mind for a decade to read chaos So when a ball snaps theres no structure Its feel So theres some art form in that that comes with it Through the process its interesting because I found another one of me Some lady in  I forget  I think she was in Beaumont area Its funny because someone made the connection So we set up two  two hubs between ourselves And so  anything on her side of town we started moving information back and forth between each otherQ:How many hours or days would you say thatA:Id say it was three days straight of pure focus And then I was flying alone for about two of the three days So I was probably about 48 hours ahead of law enforcement And then thats when Simon contacted me on the third day I was like  Okay Theyre  the municipalities are finally catching up And so what I started doing at that point is unloading all my data and people onto him And basically offloaded the books  (1) because I dont do this for a living and (2) theyve got a lot more resources on their side to actually execute the rescueQ:Got you So what was the most challenging part of thatA:So you do have to go numb because when you go into that when you subject yourself to that kind of chaos you have to go numb to the stories themselves Because I was on the phones with grandparents and addicts of houses and the waters coming up and you just move information And you know if you move the information fast enough and let enough people know about that particular coordinate that their  their probability of being saved increases Id say that was one part  just psychological  my wife was sitting beside me Shes like  You sound like a freaking robot Im like  Its not about me getting emotional with them at that time Its me moving information as fast as possible to save those individuals And so Id say that was it And then I think for the human mind I think at about day 3 is when I started  your cathexis or mental focus in a marketplace that has no structure  you can run really probably clean maybe 48 hours where youre not missing anything But the third day your mental calories are so cooked like your human will is so cooked that  it was nice that Simon and the fire department came along because obviously theyve got guys on watches and things like that So Id say as far as the challenge it was probably managing probably that many rescues from the deskQ:What about communication specific Was there any-A:Cell phone and messengerQ:Were there challenges related to using those toolsA:So a lot of it is kind of feel So like you know gut feel is  lets just say that I get a request for someone in Beaumont for rescues Hey theres a family trapped Theyve been there for three days No ones coming Help No ones answering And so you know that theres other people like me in the market playing in the same market So you push that information through that individual but you cant see the second or third layer behind So youre basically pushing information in the hopes that it will get redirected to the right person The cool thing is Ive got a few articles that came back  one of them some lady out of Hawaii contacted me I pushed some information through people that I thought and felt werent going to be rescued and then a boat showed up And theyre like  Were here for  we heard theres a married couple with two kids and a cat Specifically for them in a location At that point I didnt really have control I guess over the rescue Its just more you hear about it after the factQ:So what  you didnt really know for sure if one of them got crossed off your list of rescued or notA:You did You would hear  Id check in Id have a check in list so at the end of the day Id go rip back through the phone  Hey are you rescued And then everything was closed out And then Id go on to the next responses And then if they didnt answer their phone I took that  sometimes no response is a responseQ:Where were you getting the calls for help Were there specific Facebook pages you were seeingA:Just referrals People referring peopleQ:Okay So they would say they know that you-A:They just know that I am  that I exist in that market doing that work And then the referrals would flow from thereQ:Okay So in some cases they would follow up and say  Hey we were rescuedA:Some For the most part with the rescued if Im not hearing anything back either its a horrific story which none of that happened or they were rescuedQ:Did you interact with any of the rescue groups Like Cajun Navy Some of these others  the boating  or was it mostly individualsA:I started data aggregating because I became a known player in the response I would just basically aggregate data to my  to common pages and push that information out The Cajun Navy I just centralized it for all to see and then redirect and share back out So I think  thats the only coordinating I did was just ensuring that their information was seen by everyoneQ:Did you ever have to make decisions on like priority Like say there was someone elderly or infirm versus a 25-year old decent personA:Depending on  yeah so there was triage elevation The late  the lady that was pregnant sitting with an old lady on a fourth floor with a roof collapsing in the medical center  its real interesting When you tell that story elevate it and send the wave points out or the coordinates the psychological pressure that puts on a large group of people to help its pretty amazing to see I could feel the weight I was putting on all the people in the market that were watching So it was important  I actually let people know that people were saved because they felt an empathetic weight attached to them just for even seeing the information if that makes senseQ:Were there photos coming into you at allA:There wereQ:Did that play into your response or did those photos then get posted and sent out Or just take the info and then-A:The  some people would send photos like  Hey thanks Mostly not Once they were rescued kind of the work was done So you didnt get a lot of closure like clean closure Like  Hey Im saved People werent really that motivated  Im trying to think  they did a Fox 5  the news picked us up and it showed  the way that they did it it actually shows like  some pictures did come in And thats when it became real When the pictures came in and youre like  Oh my gosh theres a family safe on a boat smiling looking at us saying thank you That was freakin badass That was badassQ:Would you say the main entity you worked with was this department Or were you also sending this aggregated data out to like police officers and things like thatA:No  it was primarily  for 48 hours it was just me and the person that needed to be rescued and someone with a boat And then when I found out these guys were finally on it then Im like  Alright you guys its time to do your job Ive done your job long enoughQ:Did you have like an Excel spreadsheet or something you were putting things in or you just have a note sheetA:Notes yeah NotebookQ:Wow Okay So what was most helpful for you to have such an impact Is it social media or some other aspect of the eventA:Id say knowing how to leverage social media and the art of that helpsQ:When you say leverage it are you talking from just having the followers or the actual communicationA:Just knowing how to use the network Because again I do it for recruitment every day And-Q:So if federal money were to be put into using social media during future disasters what would you want to see Like how would  are the systems and the stuff we have now goodA:So I think what  I think in the findings you should  you guys  the federal government should angle cash to the  I think the best way for this to work would be if  lets just say  lets go back to Harvey Lets say Houston So event occurs and its declared like a national disaster at that point As soon as that happens the federal government should have a program set up with Facebook to immediately fund an open-portaled sponsorships for rescue coordination hubs And then tie that in with the local municipalities So say like you pre-wrap that in with like the local fire departments and you create like a centralized connection hub So basically the platform itself rather than having to pay for it  or maybe they pay for it Maybe Facebook just opens it up But open up the platform in those particular regions for data filingQ:So when you initially sent out that blast about  Hey if you have a boat and want adventure head to Texas  was that before or after the mayor kind of made the same statement  If you have a boat bring it Do you recallA:That was before That was before I was probably  if you look at the tip of the spear  so you had like initial responders like that Maybe it was Sunday night or Sunday when the water started creeping up I put the blast out Monday morning I think in that pause period I think the mayor probably kicked in maybe a day 24 hours later So itd say I was probably about 24 hours ahead of it based on what I was seeing But Id have to take a look when he actually made that announcementQ:Why do you think it is that you were 24 ahead Why were people able to much more quickly get out thereA:You know because I knew  Im a maritime guy So I understand the nature of water and how it creeps into lives from the group up So its a very rare that youll be sitting here and you and I are sitting here And if you hear about a hurricane coming its raining And then all of the sudden were suddenly trapped here But we didnt really realize itMatt 2A:Éon the art form of this Because-Q:Oh yeah I wanted to ask  you kept mentioning playbook You pulled that from PB What  what was that like Was that a guide for how to respond to disaster or-A:Yeah its just  so like when you have an oil spill or a flood or a sudden event like a spike event people just go crazy And so when you have chaos readers  and you do Theyre people who are designed for chaos that come in and bring order to it Thats kind of the differentiator that I see And I met a couple during the spill Like they were out there and we were coordinating together in the marketplace But I dont know if  I think I would probably have to write it down There are very  I think its  honestly this whole thing is probably prompting me to actually do that Yeah I think the market needs to know Because heres the deal if everyone knows how to do this  like theres a little booklet  shit hit the fan booklet  and everyone engages on social media the right way and knows how to use information I mean if you look at Katrina Katrina had like  what was it 6000 deaths or something Harvey had what 110 Think about that What was the differentiator Smartphones Thats the only differentiator that saved all those people Theres no reason  we had 110 people die in a flood that was potentially 10 times the size of Katrina Think about that Its unbelievable So yeah I need to freakin write a playbook for the betterment of mankind Because if you get enough guys doing this anytime a disaster hits theyll be like  itll be response Everyones going to be snatched up left right and center You talk about world peaceQ:So one of the last things well ask for is  we have this list of kind of features of technology that  were trying to find out whats important and what wasnt If you just want to put like a check mark Ill kind of explain some of them So locatability  this idea that smartphones can drop a pin and say  Im exactly right here If you think that was important just put a check mark You dont really have an organization So we can say for you and the people you rescuedA:So just put a check mark hereQ:Yeah if you think it was important If you really didnt use it or wouldnt use it then dont worry about itA:I didnt use it Reachability  yesQ:So you could call them basicallyA:Availability  yes yes yes Multi-media  not reallyQ:PhotosA:Ah-Q:Well they could do like photos and do internet researchA:Probably for rescue Portability  yes yes VisibilityQ:So this is the idea that you can see peoples connections Like you know that Im friends with Simon and the other professor It makes connections visible is what this is getting atA:Nah  I guess yes I mean if its important for the people  important  probably important for me important for people When there was an emotional connection it can elevate status PersistenceQ:Thats the idea that things posted stay So if somebody put up a call for help its there static on Facebook or whatever Keri come on over This is the project leader Keri StephensQ1:Hi there how are you Im Keri StephensA:Im Matt Nice to meet youQ1:Nice to meet you MattQ:He was the one in Atlanta with the hotel room set up and did the whole coordinating on the backendQ1:From a distance And this is BrettQ2:Im going to upload this real quickQ1:Sounds greatQ:Are you using the project phoneQ2:NoQ1:Let me take that Thank youQ:He might have some photos So yeah persistence  just the idea that its going to stay on the web Its not a one shot like a television broadcastA:Right Id say-Q:And then editability they could go back and edit that same post and say  Heres new information or that was incorrectA:Not really You could add to it You never wanted to edit it I guess  Q1:Thats interestingA:The only time you edit it if the address is wrong You never really want to edit because you want to  you want the timelines to be built that you want to see versus erasing or taking things down Like for instance Id leave stuff up and it was like a loose end in the minds of everyone on Facebook Youd finally write  rescued  and youd have like 10 comments  Oh my gosh thank you Its eating at my subconscious for 2 days If you didnt do that it was a loose end AssociationQ:What would you say Are we still doing associationQ1:Were you a part of any group that was kind of represented in your social media Any affiliation you might have used  maybe a part of your organization you worked for or club or anything like thatA:I own and operate a maritime recruitment company in HoustonQ1:That might be helpful thenA:That actually helps yeah I was telling him I professionally place people on ships and boats for a livingQ1:Do you reallyA:Right yeah Because of that I had like a natural playbookQ1:You did have So from that standpoint do you feel like that that was helpful for you in terms of your roleA:Oh for sure Because when you coordinate people and boats and water its a whole different realm than running a fire truck that cant get to somewhere because the water is too high So all the sudden theres this knowledge gap that forms So that I think was definitely a differentiator for my deskQ1:Was it helpful for your organization For your business in any wayA:I think probably  maybe we were seen as  What is this guy doing And so I didnt get a lot of thank yous using the platform that I built And I told him I spent the last 10 years building like 100000 followers that follow me So that was all leveraged in particular in this area So I had an existing network that was kind of tied to my company and my desk that I was usingQ:Do you live here in KatyA:I do yeah KatyQ:So did that help just knowing geographically heres Westpark Tollway heres where everything elseA:Yeah so what was happening  it was really interesting Because I was out there matching boats to people and people to boats and then youd have people with boats up in the Woodlands Theyre like  Wheres the Matt Furman of the Woodlands because everyone is trying to find the  theyve got equipment theyre ready to go but theyve got no visibility from the sky if that makes sense So that was the  Id say that was  that helped knowing the area Can I prop up and do this in San Francisco or Seattle as effectively  maybe not as a  I could probably do it but youd have to have some cash to sponsor yourself through those networks and stuff like thatQ1:Thats a good point Thats a really good pointQ:So if you have more questions go ahead but if youre willing to share photos I think you said you received some Any interactions were looking to get This is a dedicated project phone Its all secure Were not  were not interested in like who is in the photoQ1:Ultimately what were trying to do is were pulling all these images together and we have over 1000 images now in our database that weve built that are all personal images  people that we know they really did share this So were actually going to be coding those for whats in a picture a real picture when people need to be rescued and when people are rescuing others And then from that  and maps actually have also been playing I think an interesting role  from that were then going to train computers to see if they can recognize what a real call for help looks like and look for needles in haystacks in big data So thats where were headed ultimately with it So if you have any pictures that are real pictures  either things that were shared that you know were legitimate that helped connect people in any way or rescues Those are all helpful And people have done things from  I have people who literally send me  have sent me links and said  Go into this folder in my Flickr page and this is where the pictures are Weve had people who pull up their phones and say Ill give you some screenshots Ill AirDrop some things to you So anything like that You built a platform rightA:No I used just Facebook as the main  my personal Facebook page as the main kind of  so Ive got  if you go back through you can see like  I mean-Q:So if Keri friends you-A:If you guys friend me you can go through and you can see like all the activity that was flowing through that time period Its all still visibleQ1:If youd be comfortable with that that would be great Or I could even give you mine and just let you do  let you friend me so that gives you that kind option if you want to do that Let me give you a card and then Ill write down my FacebookA:This is interesting you guys are onto this Its funny because I was literally thinking yesterday that I needed to write a guide on this And then Simon reached out and he was like  Hey you guys are doing this thing Im like  This is just frickin bizarre Its just a crazy small worldQ1:Im also super interested in the role that you play that people like you played Because this navigator behind the scenes connecting people  I really-A:How many  have you guys interviewed anyQ1:You know we have probably interviewed 6 or 7Q:I interviewed one right here for the Cajun Navy primarily He was on Zello and doing what you did but on the Zello app I dont know if youve heard of the Zello appA:Yeah Ive heard of itQ1:But heres the difference Almost everyone else did it by choice You did it almost by default because you werent local Like if I were to ask you  if you had been local would you have jumped into help Would you have found a boat and gone out and rescued peopleA:So thats  you just gave me the chills Yeah Id be out there rescuing So basically I was in Denver and I was on a mountaintop off the grid and then my flight got redirected and I was trapped in Atlanta And so my only option was to go to my recruitment default which is that node connection piece which is what I do for a livingQ1:So what a lot of times people did is they didnt want to be out doing the rescue They didnt want to be in the water They didnt want to be the person who was the rescuer but they wanted to help And so almost  they took these roles of navigators to be really actively engaged and to help those people pulling people out of the water because they didnt want to be doing it But they still felt this obligation to helpQ:Or couldnt Maybe they had a bum leg or on crutchesQ1:Right And I talked to one person who  she was like 65 years old And she was like I dont have the ability to get out there and do that But I knew that I needed to support the people who wereA:So I found one other lady  someone connected us So you call them the navigators right Like chaos navigators Because theyre basically market readers and they can see the world  like you say youre going to train machines to see big data but there are people who are actually designed to operate in it I found one other lady like me in Beaumont And so what happened is she formed and she was making these connections And someone made the connection like  You guys are alike And so they connected us And all the sudden this information flow So as the storm shifted towards Port Arthur the information flow between us started picking up And so I would get requests on that side of town but from people on this time And so I would flow it through her and she sent it out and people would get rescued that way which was really coolQ1:That is really cool And actually I would love if you happen to still be connected with her  or if shes on your FacebookA:To go hunt her downQ1:I would love to Because I havent gone to Beaumont but if we get  this is  we have a lot more work we want to do in this space from a research perspective So Im going to be writing several more grants And I really want to go to Beaumont And then the other thing I really desperately want to do is  we do not have a voice of a low-income community yet in our data I want to understand more about how people in less connected neighborhoods and in low-income neighborhoods  how did they get rescued Thats kind of a dream next project And Beaumont was hit so hardA:Yeah Ill hunt her down Shes on my Facebook Its funny  shes one of those loose ends  it all ended and it was like  theres like a sister out there but Ive never met herQ1:That would be cool You should go meet herA:I should reallyQ1:Like a reunionA:We should Because  I had some lady out of Hawaii whose mother was trapped and she couldnt to her So I got the information and I sent it to this lady And then somehow a boat shows up  Im looking for this name this person I heard you have a dog and a cat and Im here for you And that information got back to this lady who happens to be like the head of The Apostles of the Sea  she runs 400 priests on merchant vessels This thing got blasted out I got like featured in this paper like the connector or whatever It was pretty cool Ill look it up Fox 5 picked us up too on one particular rescue They did a whole big story on thatQ1:Did you do any connecting of people who were in rural communities So maybe they didnt have streets where boats were coming but they were literally out in the middle of nowhere in terms of not having connectionsA:So in those situations where I didnt have particular areas theres a form of  when you push a story so a name a story and an address into an open market platform like Facebook and the crowdsourcing that funnels around that information  my methodology was  Id rather have 5 people show up and no one be there than none And so thats how I ran it Thats why I was saying  Katrina they had 6000 deaths and Houston had 110 Well the only difference between now and then was smartphones And so because of that its  theres definitely  and if you guys get this right if you guys get this research project right I mean anytime theres a major disaster and you have these navigators locked into these systems essentially you could squeeze out every gap And youre talking like child sex trafficking to like everything Something gets picked up it gets auto-sent and boom Youre through the doorQ1:I think theres a lot of potential The other big gap that I think were going to work on thats really starting to emerge is that this gap between official sources and all the volunteers that just stepped up And citizens doing this are a different beast than someone who works for fire police  works for an official  National GuardA:Thats funny There were some stories  we had these systems set up with all the guys out here It was running smooth And then the officials come up and just kick everyone out and destroy the systemQ1:Of courseA:And then at one point some of the guys are at rescue on a boat  I dont know if Id tell Simon this but the fire department show up and theyre taking selfies of themselves in front of houses just for their own PR status It was just like  they were so pissed Because  Where were you the last three days Were out here  luckily Simon came along So if you look at Simon and I  so Simon was running this thing here I was about probably 48 hours ahead Im just  Im going And then Im cooking out Im running out of cathexis and human will energy And finally Simon links up and so I got to unload all my data onto him So theres actual  so there was a point  there was a merging of the navigators with the municipality There was between Simon and I And so thats what folded a lot of that  I mean I had probably towards the end like maybe still 50-60 rescues still on a list And I just stared populating and just sending traffic towards him That because I was just  I was no longer able to keep the clean execution My wife was ready to have me back at that pointQ1:Of course So I have a question since you run a recruiting business What did you do before you started that What kind of jobA:So I went to a maritime academy in New York Called the United States Merchant Marine Academy Kingspoint New York They produce licensed mariners sailors And then I went to go work for the Port of Miami And then I got into maritime recruitment back in 2006 And then I just fell in love with recruitment Its kind of my design Im just a matchmaker in nature So when I found that and stayed in it mastered it I jettisoned in here off the back in the BP oil spill And so the BP oil spill was actually my original playbook for this because never in the history was there a spill of that magnitude that was unseen And so that was another one where I had maybe 70 people working for me through all the shipyards in the US Gulf off hiring all these vessels doing cleanup There was no playbook for that either So  there are  I think if you get  if theres a process for navigators theres  Simon and I found it We figured it outQ1:And thats whats cool is that there is that link between an official source and someone whos not in government or in  I hate to say government  but not official Thats interesting The reason I ask is I teach the sales communication class at UT in Austin and a lot of my students go into recruitingA:Do theyQ1:They do And the original connection that I got to Katy was through an alum from our college who saw a write up when I first got the grant and I have  he runs a staffing company in HoustonA:Whats it calledQ1:Phil Vanderslice Its called Rekruiters with a K And hes just been wildly successful He hired one of my students 8 or 9 years ago And he ended up letting her spin off part of his company and run her own recruiting company And weve stayed in contact Hes been really happy because I send him good students And he literally called me and said You need to get a hold of these people They did really amazing things in unexpected ways I was like Okay Phil So that was my connection to Katy was through a recruiterA:Thats coolQ1:So I was just curiousA:Yeah the recruitment business  its an art formQ1:It is an art form And its all about relationships which it sounds like you used a lot of that skill set in creating this playbook for connecting peopleA:Yeah Its  I need to write a guide for sureQ1:You really should I think that your experience and your background is unique enough that it would also really stand out It sounds like you have some insight into how these processes might work that other people dont SoA:Ive had to do it out of survival Four kidsQ1:Wow you have four kidsA:Stay at home wife So yeah Its for survival Ive had to master the art formQ1:And what are their age rangesA:3 5 7 9Q1:Oh my gosh Wow I dont know how anybody has more than two I have two and I thought  that was enoughA:I just for spring break just put my wife and all four on a plane right before this So Im solo So Ive got them off my back for a week Shes not happy right nowQ1:I bet I bet Well thank you so much for your timeEND OF RECORDING2
