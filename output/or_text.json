No one is adding anything. They grabbed an old list that had 9 neighborhoods that don't exist and missed 6 that do.\" That said, be vigilant. Evacuate if you can to higher ground.

I don't see many meteorologists talking about what I'm going to outline here and its serious stuff folks. I've been noting since the beginning of the week here on FB that there's a very good possibility that after Harvey makes landfall near Corpus Christi, it will loop back into the Gulf of Mexico, crawl up the coastline, and then make landfall again next week near the Texas-Louisiana border. Now it looks like the second landfall will be slightly Northeast of Galveston (not the TX/LA border) and will come in around Tues or Weds of next week - as a major hurricane AGAIN!

        "text": "I'm tired. Tired of rain, tired of worrying, tired of not sleeping. But safe!!! And so so grateful that we are dry and were able to help in at least a small way today. Nathan and Clint launched his boat (thanks to Mike Loftin pulling them deep enough with his tractor!) and rescued some friends and their dog. Then Nate went back in and rescued about 25 more people. Love how our community is banding together, and beyond grateful for the volunteers and emergency response crews who are out there assisting people. Big shout out to the and the community. l've now seen firsthand how tired the firefighters are, and never really realized until these last few days just how much their families sacrifice When they're working for days on end on our behalf, their families are home without them, and that sucks. THANKS to the other crews out there!!! : families for their help to and all ",
