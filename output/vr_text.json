        "text": "I got a two-minute \"training\" session and a \"good luck!\" One of the key suggestions of the training session was that when I received a rescue request, I needed to try to call the person making the request if possible to get more details and to ensure that it was a legitimate request. Unfortunately, there had been reports of people calling in fake rescue requests and then robbing the volunteers when they arrived. Despicable After I received each request and had called the person making the request, I was to log their information on a designated website, let the requestor know the \"ID number\" they'd been assigned and move on to the next call Within minutes, I was on the phone with Karen. Karen was in a house in Port Arthur, sitting on her kitchen cabinet with seven other adults, two teenagers and a newborn. The water was almost to the counter tops. I assured here we would get someone to her as soon as we could and told her to stay safe. It was 1:15 a.m By this time, Cajun Navy rescuers had begun arriving in Port Arthur. They were begging to be let in the water, but the Coast Guard understandably wouldn't grant them permission because the storm was just too strong. It was gut-wrenching to hear so many calls coming in and having to tell them there was nothing we could do until the storm calmed down a little The local authorities were doing the best they could, but they were far out-numbered and also unable to get to everyone in the treacherous conditions I took several more calls and quickly realized there was no way I could call to verify every request. They were coming in faster than I could type them into the website databank. I would listen to the request, write down their info and start typing it in. In the time I could enter one request, three more would come in. I was originally just sitting up in bed with my laptop on my lap, phone in hand and a notepad on my nightstand. Pretty quickly I moved to my dining room table, plugged in my computer and phone and poured a huge glass of iced tea. I started out taking notes nice and neat on printer paper. That quickly turned into chaotic scribbles. I was having trouble reading my own handwriting at times I got a request from Chad. I had enough time to call him. Trapped in their house, he and his wife had water up to their chest. He told me they were about to go to their attic. I begged him not to do that and told him he had to go to his roof instead. He said there was no way for them to do that. I told him he didn't have a choice. I asked him to keep calling 911, over and over. When we hung up, I texted him other numbers to try -the Coast Guard, the Jefferson County Office of Emergency Management, the Air Force. It was 2:20 a.m I spoke to another woman whose name I can't even remember. I didn't call her directly but we had a few exchanges through the app. She told me she and her kids were sitting on their kitchen counter and needed rescuing, but she was scared to get off the counter when boats arrived because there were snakes in the water in their house ",

        "text": "because there were snakes in the water in their house I took request after request after request. Name...phone number...address...number of adults...number of children...number of elderly...medical conditions. I would then type this information in as fast I could so the dispatchers could send the rescuers out. After submitting the information, I received an ID number that I was supposed to relay to the person requesting the rescue. We asked them to remember the number so they could give it to their rescuers when they were finally picked up. We could then mark them safe in the system, avoiding the dilemma of rescuers looking for people who had already been saved by someone else It was around this time that I heard one of the dispatchers who goes by Goose ping in to our channel to let us know that the Cajun Navy still had NO boats on the water. Conditions were still too dangerous. I had mistakenly assumed we had boats in the water by then. No wonder we had so many people desperately begging for rescue. No one was coming for them. All night long I had been telling them to \"hang on, we'll be there soon.\" I didn't know I had been lying to them Around 3:00 a.m., I got a request from a teenage boy in Orange who was screaming so hysterically I couldn't even understand him. I got his phone number and told him I'd call him directly. The second he answered, he was screaming that his brother and cousin were laying in the backyard unresponsive, possibly electrocuted. I'm sad to say that I don't even remember this boy's name. I know I asked, but in the conversation that ensued, I forgot it. He told me that his brother and cousin had been near a shed in the backyard for over an hour, but they couldn't get to them because of the rising water and the storm. I told him they needed to try to get to them and that I was getting help to them as soon as I could. I think he thought I was an official 911 dispatcher, as he kept asking me why the police weren't there. He said he'd called 911 \"at least 100 times\" and they never answered. He then told me he and another cousin were going to go outside to check on the young men in the yard. I told him l'd wait. He put the phone down. I listened. And waited I could hear panicked conversation and rain and sloshing water. After a very long seven or eight minutes, I suddenly heard the most blood curdling, gut wrenching screaming l've ever heard. I heard a little girl screaming at the top of her lungs. I heard a boy's voice screaming \"no, no, no, noooooo\" over and over. I felt nauseous. And completely helpless I started screaming into the phone...\"Hello! Hello!\" He picked up the phone \"Miss, I think my brother is dead! He's not breathing! Should we do CPR? What do we do?\" \"Do you know CPR? Yes, try CPR!\" \"What do I do\" he screamed Before I could answer, he dropped the phone again. More chaos. More ",

I'm trying to get some help to you. Tell me what's going on. What's your name?\" \"Margaret. My boy is gone! His lips are purple. He's gone.\" I desperately searched for words \"Margaret, I'm so very sorry. Where is your nephew?\" \"He's in the yard. They're trying to get him now.\" \"Who else is with you?\" Margaret told me she was with her other kids 4 or 5 people total, if I remember correctly - and that they were up to their waist in water \"My boy is on the table.\" Her voice cracked. \"They're out there trying to get my nephew now. Please get someone here, please,\" she begged I assured her we would. But I knew there were still no boats in the water I hung up and immediately called the Coast Guard number we'd been given. They answered immediately, but the person I was talking to was actually in Houston. I quickly explained who I was and what I had just experienced and gave them Margaret's address. He assured me he would let the Coast Guard in Orange know about Margaret's family. I hung up and called the Jefferson County OEM. Shockingly, he answered on the second ring \"Address!\" he barked \"Hi, my name is Holly Har-\" \"I know why you're calling! Where are you?\" \"I don't need help. I'm working with the Cajun Navy dispatchers and need someone to get to a family I just spoke with.\" I explained the situation and gave them Margaret's address \"Jesus Christ,\" he sighed. He sounded completely defeated \"I know you're doing the best you can. Just please get to this family.\" \"We will. We're going to have a lot of deaths here tonight.\" I got up from my table to take a break and to try to process what had just happened. I had just interjected myself into a family's most horrible moment. As quickly as I had crossed paths with them, they were gone. A 15 minute interaction that will stay with me for a lifetime I went to the bathroom, refilled my tea, walked around a bit, thinking to ",

        "text": "I went to the bathroom, refilled my tea, walked around a bit, thinking to myself, \"what are you doing?? You're not qualified to do this!\" Then I sat back down and went back to it. Around 4:30, I got a request from a young woman in Beaumont who was trying to get her 87-year old grandfather, Chester, rescued in Port Arthur He lived alone and had water to his shins. I couldn't hear her well through the app, so I called her directly. She told me her grandfather couldn't get through to 911 and she was really scared for him. I assured her someone would get to him and that he would be okay. There were still no Cajun Navy boats in the water At some point, I'd heard another volunteer mention that a woman who lived on Sassine Street and her three kids had retreated to their attic to escape rising waters. I pinged in and told the volunteer that she had to call the woman back and tell her to get OUT of the attic and go to her roof. The volunteer came back on the line and said that she'd talked to the woman, but she refused to move because her kids couldn't swim. I asked if she had anything they could use to break through the attic roof 0 We got word around 7:30 a.m. Wednesday - seven hours after the first calls stared coming in from Port Arthur that the Cajun Navy had finally been let in the water. Reports of rescues started coming in. I was finally able to mark one of my cases \"safe.\" I kept taking calls all day Wednesday. Throughout the night and into Wednesday, I was texting with Chad and Shaundra, the young woman calling for her grandfather. Chad told me the water was almost to their necks and they still hadn't gone to the roof. Shaundra texted me repeatedly, asking why no one had gotten to her grandfather. The water had risen to his chest. I promised her someone would get there The rescues and the \"safe\" status reports were increasing by the hour. I turned on the TV at some point and started seeing scenes of the same people and situations I was listening to on the app. Around 10:00, I heard one of the rescuers who uses the handle Cowboy ask about \"the woman in the attic on Sassine Street.\" immediately pinged in, and Cowboy asked me to call him. He wanted the address again and wanted to know when we had last heard from the lady in the attic. I told him I had no idea because the volunteer who originally took that call had signed off Cowboy said he was a few minutes away from Sassine St. and didn't know if he should request another boat with \"breeching equipment\" or a helicopter. I suggested helicopter, hoping the family had somehow made it to the roof The calls for rescue were slowing down, but continued to come in at a steady pace. Every 20-30 minutes, I'd remind the rescuers that Chester, Shaundra's grandfather, still needed a rescue from 19th Street. And I kept telling Shaundra that they would get there. She finally said she was just going to get in the car and drive from Beaumont to Port Arthur to get him herself. I told her to be careful and let me know she made it. 20 minutes ",

        "text": "herself. I told her to be careful and let me know she made it. 20 minutes later she texted me to say that they'd been stopped by flood waters and couldn't get there. She told she was afraid he was going to die Around 11:30, I realized I hadn't heard Cowboy on the line with a report about Sassine Street. I asked on the app if we had had any update. My phone rang. It was Cowboy \"We got to Sassine. It's confirmed.\" \"Confirmed?\" I frantically asked. \"Confirmed what? What does that mean? Does that mean they're dead?\" \"Yes. Water past the roof. They never left the attic. We sent divers in.\" I thanked him for letting me know and off he went to the next rescue At 3:02 p.m., I got a text from Shaundra that said \"[Mam], I thank you so much. He is on his way to the bowling alley.\" A few minutes later: \"Thank you [mam]. He was on a boat at first now he is on a truck.\" I let out a huge sigh of relief. I think I may have actually said \"Thank you, God\" out loud I texted Chad at 5:30 p.m. to see if he was safe. I didn't hear back from him until 7:30 Thursday morning. \"We are safe now.\" I pinged Goose to ask him if he knew if Margaret, the mother who lost two boys, and her other kids had been rescued. He said they had. I have texted Margaret to ask her how she was doing. I still haven't heard from her. I've been scanning reports from Orange to see if her family has been mentioned. I need to know the names of the two boys who died At 6:00 p.m. Wednesday, I closed my laptop. I'd been awake 34 hours and wasn't even tired. I was emotionally drained, but there was no way l could've slept right then. I thought back on the last day and half and couldn't believe what I had just heard and experienced. Even as I type this, it seems surreal. I don't know how police officers and firefighters and 911 dispatchers and EMTs do this every day. What I do know... I am grateful beyond measure that they do it. And thank God for the Cajun Navy. How many more people would be dead today if not for our first responders and the thousands of volunteers here? What if a flood of this magnitude had happened 20 years ago, before cell phones and social media? The deaths would be in the hundreds. I saw a meme on Facebook today that said, \"Someone needs to erect a statue honoring the regular dude with a bass boat.\" It was meant to be funny, but it's actually spot on. On Thursday, I got another text from Shaundra. It was a picture of her and her grandfather. I sent a selfie back to her and told her I was going to find a way to meet them in person someday. I really hope I get to do that. I mean are they at my papa cause he heard them outside and he went out side idk if they got him on ",

This is one of thousands of stories being told in Houston this week. \"Crazy\" doesn't even begin to describe the last six days in my city. I'm sorry for making you all scroll so far down your timeline to get past this post but I don't know how to post as a PDF on Facebook. If someone knows a better way, please let me know! If you have 10-15 minutes to spare, you can read this story, which will also explain the pictures After watching nonstop coverage of the hurricane and the incredible rescues that were taking place, I got in bed at 10:30 on Tuesday night. I had been glued to the TV for days. Every time I would change the channel in an attempt to get my mind on something else for a few minutes, I was drawn right back in. I finally turned off the TV and picked up my phone to do a quick check of email and Facebook. I read an article about the Cajun Navy and the thousands of selfless volunteers who have shown up to this city en masse. The article explained they were using a walkie talkie type app called Zello to communicate with each other, locate victims, get directions, etc. I downloaded the app, found the Cajun Navy channel and started listening. I was completely enthralled. Voice after voice after voice coming though my phone in the dark, some asking for help, some saying they were on their way. Most of the transmissions l was hearing when I first tuned in were from Houston, but within 30 minutes or so, calls started coming in from Port Arthur and Orange Harvey had moved east from Houston and was pummeling East Texas Call after call from citizens saying they were trapped in their houses and needed boat rescue. None of the volunteer rescuers had made it to that area from Houston, but as soon as the calls started coming in, they were moving out, driving as fast as they could into the middle of Harvey As I was listening, I quickly figured out that there were a few moderators on the app that were in charge and very experienced in using this method of communication during emergencies. One in particular, Brittney, was giving directions, taking rescue requests, and prioritizing calls and rescues. At one point, she said something that made me realize she's a nurse, so l immediately understood why she was so effective in this situation. A couple of other women (who were working from other parts of the country, not Houston) who had been taking calls from victims and logging in the information came on the line around 12:30 and said they had to sign off so they could get to bed. They asked if there was anyone who could work through the night to keep taking rescue requests and log them. I sat up and turned on my light. I timidly pushed the \"talk\" button and said \"I can.\" I got a two-minute \"training\" session and a \"good luck!\" One of the key ",

A lot of us may go back to work or school after another week or so, but we will have friends who will need our help for much longer than that.

We will need to reach below 97' before we see all of our homes and businesses free of internal water We need to reach below 95' before we see all water recede off our streets and back into the reservoir Sewer Plant is still not operating!! Cinco MUD 5, 6, 7 and 8 Affected New info: Per Mike Price, MUD Board 7 Bayou Oaks and Hunters Glen in MUD 7 are not part of the affected area These two neighborhoods are serviced by a functioning sewer plant. Please use bathroom, kitchen, and utility as normal Critical: For those who are going into the standing water: The levels of toxicity are EXTREMELY high. We have rotting corpses of animals and fecal matter floating in still waters. Please use good judgment. We do not want our community to suffer further harm nor do we want to further overwhelm our hospitals with cases of life-threatening bacteria infections.\" ",

Manhole covers have been blown off, and the holes are exposed under water. Since you cannot see them as you wade through the water, the danger is that you will step into the hole and be drug underneath into the sewer pipe. This is absolutely a life-threatening hazard!! We have already lost a life in Old Town Katy due to this issue. Please do not walk through the standing water. High trucks are available at the command post at Mason to escort you to your home 2. The Army Corps of Engineers will be assessing our bridges that were compromised during the flood. No bridge in our area has been inspected as of today, Sunday, September 3rd. We cannot guarantee your safety if you choose to walk across the bridges that are still in the mandatory evacuation zone. Please take every precaution. 3. It is NOT recommended to access property in mandatory evacuation zones, but, if you choose to access your home, please use kayaks ONLY Boats are now getting damaged by fire hydrants, low water areas, and other debris \"Update per Julie Millen: As of 4:00pm The National Guard has removed the Command Center at Mason Road Best Trash Link to Current Info: http://www.best-trash.com/ Texas Pride Disposal Link to Current Info: http://www.texaspridedisposal.com/ ",

They gave me a shot, antibiotics and cream. It definitely was infected, and would have definitely escalated quickly if left untreated. The Doctor did urge anyone who has been in the water to watch yourself very carefully for the next few days. The toxicity Sunday and Monday was less intense than as time went on (hence the beautiful brown color). Sharing for those who would normally tough it out. Just go get checked out!

I know it's a tall order but I just want us and all of our friends to get out safely Not sure where we are headed yet but can't pick a destination until the morning, depending on the conditions. Evacuating is extremely, extremely dangerous, I know that sounds easy (it was Thursday), but it is not now. Roads are flooded everywhere There are so many already so badly affected. We have the means to do whatever we need and we have another home we can go to if needed. So many do not. We are so fortunate and so many are not. Thank you all so much for all the love and concern.

Refrain from bathing, washing clothes, and using your dishwasher. Showers, use of toilets, brushing teeth are acceptable. When will repairs be made? Until the water recedes we are unable to evaluate the condition of the assets. As soon as possible, we will deploy pumping equipment at district lift stations to relieve the system. Once water has receded, we will be able to mobilize on-site and evaluate the damage and begin repairs to the wastewater plant. However, this is totally dependent upon the water receding. Whose fault is this? Didn't the MUDs prepare? MUDs are designed and required to build to certain criteria to protect customers from many events. Harvey brought in excess of 50 inches of rain to our area. In an area with the topography that Houston has, there is no amount of planning and preparation that can adequately deal with 50 inches of rain. CInco ranch has taken extreme measures to protect its facilities and its customers but this event was of such great magnitude there was no way to repair or mitigate what this storm brought.

My understanding is that it is the southwest corner of George Bush Park near Canyon Gate (I confirmed with WFDD legal and am also in the process of confirming with our civil engineer). The top of the spillway is at 107.6'. The theory is that because the water goes around the spillway, the water level never reaches the top of the spillway. The Army Corps of Engineers is releasing water from the Barker and Addicks Dams at a high rate. The gauge at Piney Point and Buffalo Bayou is registering 10,300 cubic feet per second. Despite this high rate of release, the Barker Reservoir continues to rise. I have included the chart for Buffalo Bayou at Peek Rd Please make plans for your family accordingly. adjustment.

        "text": "PLEASE SHARE UPDATED INFO Latest Update as of 9:40pm Barker Reservoir is at 99.94' which is an increase of just under 9 inches in 4 hours. The new water flow rate below Barker Dam at Piney Point and Buffalo Bayou is 11,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) which is a 700 cfs increase from 4 hours ago. At 104' the water in the reservoir will start spilling around the corner of the dam at the southwest corner of George Bush Park near Canyon Gate. The top of the spillway is at 107.6'. The theory is that because the water goes around the spillway, the water level never reaches the top of the spillway. The Army Corps of Engineers is releasing water from the Barker and Addicks Dams at a high rate. Again, the gauge at Piney Point and Buffalo Bayou is registering 11,000 cubic feet per second. Despite this high rate of release, the Barker Reservoir continues to rise because of the added rain drain off from our Bayou and ditches I have included the chart for Buffalo Bayou at Peek Rd. Please make plans for your family accordingly. A \"Find My Elevation\" link is in the comments below Barker Reservoir Elevation 2010 Barker Dam Cross Section Barker Reservoir Elevation ",

Confirmed current level of the Barker reservoir is 101.41 - please see picture below. If you are in the Blue Area and at an elevation of less than 104.5', your home will most likely get water in it. IMPORTANT: As the bayou and ditches continue to drain into the reservoir and fill it to the 104' mark (and we have a LOT more water draining from the west), the overflow will spill further into our neighborhoods. Once the level reaching the 104' spillway, the theory is that no additional water will be added to our neighborhoods.

The next news conference is scheduled for 7:30 PM. The Army Corps of Engineers stated earlier today that they are releasing water off the dam that is flowing toward Houston at a rate between 6000 and 8000 ft.3 per second. Can someone put a link in the comment section that shows us the actual release rate currently? I'm on I-10 driving back to Katy and cannot search for the data. During normal rain events, the Army Corps of Engineers will release the dam at 2000 ft.3 per second. This amount will lower the Barker Reservoir levels by 1 inch per day. A release rate of 8000 ft.3 per second will represent a decreased level in the reservoir by 2 to 4 inches per day depending on how much water is still being added to the reservoir from the Bayou and ditches. Our area needs to drain 5-6 feet before water is out of all the houses in our area. Please use this information to calculate a rough estimate of how many days it will be before you can get back into your house. ",

One final note, if you stay in your home, don't leave unless you have an emergency, If you exit the evacuation area to get a few groceries, law enforcement cannot allow you to re-enter the area Stay safe Comment 15 Shares Share Fort Bend County Judge esterday at 11.26 AM- Latest updates from Judge Hebert 08/30/17 1030am Judge Hebert River Flooding Video Update Wednesday Morning Augus \u534f30AM Shares Wendy I wish everyone in Katy had access to your updates on the reservoir situation.

The Sheriff and Judge made this decision last night, but the maps are wrong. Please stand by, Comm. Meyers is working to fix this. There is no new flooding, the water is going down, not up. There is no reason for this mandatory evacuation, it is an over-reaction to the sense that too many people were trying to get back to their flooded homes. My home is flooded too, so I am frustrated too, but there is no reason to prepare to evacuate or anything else. Remain calm and stay put if you are safe and dry.

EVERYONE is doing their part - donations, food drives, demos of houses, loaning out cars, housing friends, listening to people and their stories.. & hugging people when they need it most. I wanted to share a few pics of what's happening w Natl Guard.. they are helping get those still in the mandatory evac areas to homes/apts to get any left pets (fish, birds, etc) or medicines. I am grateful that each day we get a couple more trucks and we're figuring how to get a little more organized. Please keep in mind that this whole rebuild process will be a marathon event. A lot of us may go back to work or school after another week or so, but we will have friends who will need our help for much longer than that.

Mucking is very dangerous now and we need to take protective precautions or leave to pros although I know there are not enough pros to go around. Please be safe. You will not know you are contaminated until days or weeks after exposure causing grave danger or life long illness. At a minimum current Tetanus, Hep A vaccine and antibiotic coverage. Cover skin completely, wear mask rated 95 or higher, waterproof heavy duty shoes, heavy duty gloves. Wash hands/body asap after exposure. If mold is visible it is too late unless you really know wh.

I'm here all day and can help facilitate people to borrow. People do not need to be in these waters unprotected. Which leads me to the PSA - it's been confirmed that the flood waters have tested positive for E coli- folks this is no joke. Do not play around with these conditions. And if you must be in it, they are recommending you shower & clean immediately & if you can, get antibiotics. God bless, stay safe and be nice to your neighbors. It's a hard week on everyone. ",

Normally I would have treated it at home but given I spent a number of hours in toxic flood waters (as SOOO many did), so l went to have it looked at. I'm glad I did! They gave me a shot, antibiotics and cream. It definitely was infected, and would have definitely escalated quickly if left untreated. The Doctor did urge anyone who has been in the water to watch yourself very carefully for the next few days. The toxicity Sunday and Monday was less intense than as time went on (hence the beautiful brown color). Sharing for those who would normally tough it out. Just go get checked out! Thanks to the power from Witte Blue to make sure I got this looked at as well!
