The good news is we have 2 floors in our house and have managed to relocate most of our belongings upstairswhich should remain dry. The downside is if we do end up flooded then we could have water in the house for up to a few months - fecking disaster! So keep us in your thoughts, we've got another few days to get through. We've prepped for the worst and ",

Wrongly assumed I could get to the same pick up point as earlier, turned around but ended up between two low points on Fry Rd. Watched jeeps and trucks push through but wasn't sure about my van. A family in a truck stopped to make sure l was ok while I waited for a small lessening of torrential rain rate. Did a lot of praying and drove through safely to high ground. Now just waiting. Have been pretty tough and pragmatic and grateful for our house until standing in line at Kroger reading all the desperate calls for help and seeing even more photos of my beloved community under water. That's when the tears started But God is good, God is faithful. #Harvey #hurricaneharvey ",

Our adrenaline has been pumping hard for two weeks, but now things are starting to catch up to us and to sink in. I call this \"Harvey Fatigue.\" The emotional trauma of what has happened to our community is beginning to take its toll. Most people are back to work and back to school, and yet thousands are dealing with the aftermath of flooded homes. Some neighborhoods look like nothing ever happened. Others look like war zones with muck-out debris filling up front yards like a massive junk yard. Some are dealing with despair. Others are dealing with survivors' guilt (which is a lie from the enemy) So proud of Houston community, family and amazing friend circle that we made through out the years. We could not have done this without your support. Thanks everyone from bottom of our heart!! ",

That is the miracle, a million times over. They are vital and thriving. They are living life the right way. They are Texans.
