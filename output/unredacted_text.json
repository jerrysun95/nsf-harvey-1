August 28 Katy.a Slightly shaken but safe now, waiting to retrieve another friend's family from their flooding neighborhood. Wrongly assumed I could get to the same pick up point as earlier, turned around but ended up between two low points on Fry Rd. Watched jeeps and trucks push through but wasn't sure about my van. A family in a truck stopped to make sure I was ok while I waited for a small lessening of torrential rain rate. Did a lot of praying and drove through safely to high ground. Now just waiting. Have been pretty tough and pragmatic and grateful for our house until standing in line at Kroger reading all the desperate calls for help and seeing even more photos of my beloved community under water. That's when the tears started. But God is good, God is faithful. #Harvey #hurricaneharvey Write a comment ... ",

I call this \"Harvey Fatigue.\" The emotional trauma of what has happened to our community is beginning to take its toll. Most people are back to Work and back to school, and yet thousands are dealing with the aftermath of flooded homes, Some neighborhoods look like nothing ever happened. Others look like war zones with muck-out debris filling up front yards like a massive junk yard. Some are dealing with despair. Others are dealing with survivors' guilt (which is a lie from the enemy) So proud of Houston community, family and amazing friend circle that we made through out the years. We could not have done this without your support. Thanks everyone from bottom of our heart!! ",

EVERYONE is doing their part donations, food drives, demos of houses, loaning out cars, housing friends, listening to people and their stories.. & hugging people when they need it most. I wanted to share a few pics of what's happening w Natl Guard.. they are helping get those still in the mandatory evac areas to homes/apts to get any left pets (fish, birds, etc) or medicines. I am grateful that each day we get a couple more trucks and we're figuring how to get a little more organized lease keep in mind that this whole rebuild process will be a marathon event. A lot of us may go back to work or school after another week or so, but we will have friends who will need our help for much longer than that. Scott and I will be back at our post in the morning as we've grown quite fond of our fellow volunteers and want to complete this current mission.

Manhole covers have been blown off, and the holes are exposed under water. Since you cannot see them as you wade through the water, the danger is that you will step into the hole and be drug underneath into the sewer pipe. This is absolutely a life-threatening hazard!! We have already lost a life in Old Town Katy due to this issue. Please do not walk through the standing water. High trucks are available at the command post at Mason to escort you to your home 2. The Army Corps of Engineers will be assessing our bridges that were compromised during the flood. No bridge in our area has been inspected as of today, Sunday, September 3rd. We cannot guarantee your safety if you choose to walk across the bridges that are still in the mandatory evacuation zone. Please take every precaution. 3. It is NOT recommended to access property in mandatory evacuation zones, but, if you choose to access your home, please use kayaks ONLY Boats are now getting damaged by fire hydrants, low water areas, and other debris \"Update per Julie Millen: As of 4:00pm The National Guard has removed the Command Center at Mason Road Best Trash Link to Current Info: http://www.best-trash.com/ Texas Pride Disposal Link to Current Info: http://www.texaspridedisposal.com/ ",

They gave me a shot, antibiotics and cream. It definitely was infected, and would have definitely escalated quickly if left untreated. The Doctor did urge anyone who has been in the water to watch yourself very carefully for the next few days. The toxicity Sunday and Monday was less intense than as time went on (hence the beautiful brown color). Sharing for those who would normally tough it out. Just go get checked out! Thanks to the power from Witte Blue to make sure I got this looked at as well! Given their recent experiences, they did not take this lightly, and neither did I ",

Evacuating is extremely, extremely dangerous, I know that sounds easy (it was Thursday), but it is not now. Roads are flooded everywhere There are so many already so badly affected. We have the means to do whatever we need and we have another home we can go to if needed. So many do not. We are so fortunate and so many are not. Thank you all so much for all the love and concern.

Refrain from bathing, washing clothes, and using your dishwasher. Showers, use of toilets, brushing teeth are acceptable. When will repairs be made? Until the water recedes we are unable to evaluate the condition of the assets. As soon as possible, we will deploy pumping equipment at district lift stations to relieve the system. Once water has receded, we will be able to mobilize on-site and evaluate the damage and begin repairs to the wastewater plant. However, this is totally dependent upon the water receding. Whose fault is this? Didn't the MUDs prepare? MUDs are designed and required to build to certain criteria to protect customers from many events. Harvey brought in excess of 50 inches of rain to our area. In an area with the topography that Houston has, there is no amount of planning and preparation that can adequately deal with 50 inches of rain.

So disappointed in some of the official communications and the press coverage. It helped to have a source of clear, calm straightforward info to use to make decisions. Not sure I would have been as comfortable making the choices we did if I was relying on tv, internet and random internet info. Hope you step away for a few minutes to relax and get some sleep tonight. Like Comment Share Wendy Duncan and 21 others Wendy Duncan Thank you, Joy! I'm so glad the information has been helpful and you used it to make the best decisions for your family! I will try to get some sleep tonight. Like so many of us, I'm exhausted (I tagged everyone three separate times in my last post because I kept deleting instead of pushing done. ). Sleep well tonight, Write a comment GIF ",

The Sheriff and Judge made this decision last night, but the maps are wrong. Please stand by, Comm. Meyers is working to fix this. There is no new flooding, the water is going down, not up. There is no reason for this mandatory evacuation, it is an over-reaction to the sense that too many people were trying to get back to their flooded homes. My home is flooded too, so I am frustrated too, but there is no reason to prepare to evacuate or anything else. Remain calm and stay put if you are safe and dry.

The current level of the Barker Reservoir is 101.42 Per Severn Trent, if you receive a water bill from them, your water is ok to use. The next news conference is scheduled for 7:30 PM The Army Corps of Engineers stated earlier today that they are releasing water off the dam that is flowing toward Houston at a rate between 6000 and 8000 ft3 per second. Can someone put a link in the comment section that shows us the actual release rate currently? I'm on l-10 driving back to Katy and cannot search for the data. During normal rain events, the Army Corps of Engineers will release the dam at 2000 ft.3 per second. This amount will lower the Barker Reservoir levels by 1 inch per day. A release rate of 8000 ft.3 per second will represent a decreased level in the reservoir by 2 to 4 inches per day depending on how much water is still being added to the reservoir from the Bayou and ditches. Our area needs to drain 5-6 feet before water is out of all the houses in our area Please use this information to calculate a rough estimate of how many days it will be before you can get back into your house.

The new water flow rate below Barker Dam at Piney Point and Buffalo Bayou is 11,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) which is a 700 cfs increase from 4 hours ago. At 104' the water in the reservoir will start spilling around the corner of the dam at the southwest corner of George Bush Park near Canyon Gate. The top of the spillway is at 107.6'. The theory is that because the water goes around the spillway, the water level never reaches the top of the spillway. The Army Corps of Engineers is releasing water from the Barker and Addicks Dams at a high rate. Again, the gauge at Piney Point and Buffalo Bayou is registering 11,000 cubic feet per second. Despite this high rate of release, the Barker Reservoir continues to rise because of the added rain drain off from our Bayou and ditches I have included the chart for Buffalo Bayou at Peek Rd. Please make plans for your family accordingly. A \"Find My Elevation\" link is in the comments below Barker Reservoir Elevation 2010 Barker Dam Cross Section Barker Reservoir Elevation ",

We are in the second floor at a neighbors Water has been rising but seems to be holding right now. I had water in the bathroom coming through plumbing this morning but Nothing catastrophic. We were standing in the garage at the neighbors tonight and heard the transformer in our back yard blow and our house went dark. Not sure if it was from water in the backyard. I am very grateful for awesome friends who have put us up and hopefully we can stay put until the water recedes. Our street was a boat freeway today. You? 17w Like Reply 2 Write a comment GIF ",

He and his wife are currently in Norway and have had her son living in the house alone for a few years while he finishes school at UH. They have not heard from him since Monday. Jon tried to get close to the house yesterday.. but water too high and not allowed anyway. I contacted Andrea McDonald Witte at the command post on Westheimer and she sent the Army Guard into check. No one at the house. This is so strange. Does anyone live in this neighborhood?I guess l'll suggest to have him added to missing persons. Not sure what else to do....

I am grateful that each day we get a couple more trucks and we're figuring how to get a little more organized Please keep in mind that this whole rebuild process will be a marathon event.

People do not need to be in these waters unprotected. Which leads me to the PSA - it's been confirmed that the flood waters have tested positive for E coli- folks this is no joke. Do not play around with these conditions. And if you must be in it, they are recommending you shower & clean immediately & if you can, get antibiotics. God bless, stay safe and be nice to your neighbors It's a hard week on everyone. 10 Comments 15 Shares Like Comment Share Andrea McDonald Witte September 2, 2017 Cinco Ranch 2 ",

PSA for those who have been in the flood waters.. I got bitten by something (probably some fire ants), and noticed swelling and redness. Normally I would have treated it at home but given I spent a number of hours in toxic flood waters (as SOOO many did), so l went to have it looked at. I'm glad I did! They gave me a shot, antibiotics and cream. It definitely was infected, and would have definitely escalated quickly if left untreated The Doctor did urge anyone who has been in the water to watch yourself very carefully for the next few days. The toxicity Sunday and Monday was less intense than as time went on (hence the beautiful brown color). Sharing for those who would normally tough it out. Just go get checked out! Thanks to the power from Witte Blue to make sure l got this looked at as well! Given their recent experiences, they did not take this lightly, and neither did Just another example of all of this taking the best Village ever! 2 ",

I spent the day with the absolutely incredible Andrea McDonald Witte by my side doing whatever we could. Our hearts sank when the call came in to the PD we were with reporting shots fired at the corner of where We live. We left our phones behind so we could wade through chest deep water as we were dragging boats across bridges and streets. Not heroic, just facts. Thankfully, our families we confirmed safe then we went back to the purpose of our day I will be at the Mason Road command post tomorrow again at 8:30 am. All are welcome. If you want evacuated, send me addresses and we'll get people out (yes some have stayed!) Tonight, we will be gathering with my running family for hugs, hugs, and more hugs, and laughs, beer, food and whatever else!

Hey all, just a quick update since I just got my phone back in my hands.. all is good- Julie Jackson Millen & I are were never in harms way as we were WITH the authorities on a boat helping evacuate, far away from the road rage shooting. I was more concerned for Connor who was working with friends at the church on the same intersection as the shooting. The kids & volunteers sheltered in place. Lee Werner Witte was my guardian angel since Scott Witte & I were volunteering in diff spots & she was able to be my eyes and ears People. Seriously. It's been a hard week on everyone. We all need to step back & regroup cause shooting a person multiple times over getting mad in your car is just kooky. After seeing the love & teamwork this week, this makes me sad cause it's not indicative of who we are. Hug and love one another y'all- it's not that hard, l promise Speech over. 00 66 20 Comments 1 Share Like Comment Share 2 ",

I know I'm tired.. no snarky comments, just sharing pics from this morning's walk I do think I'm gonna ask for a refund.. the water coaster ride we've been on has sucked. One minute, I'm thinking we're all good, next minute, we get another ominous text, automated call, etc about stupid reservoir. I know more about house elevations, spillways, apps like Zellow that act like walkie talkies in emerg situation to know! than l've ever wanted Most all of our neighbors are still planning on riding this out.. I appreciate all the offers.. we think this is still the option for us. The sirens & the helicopters all day long have been crazy, little out of place for our area For those who have flooded, my heart goes out to you & Scott & I are ready to help in any way we can.. So many friends have been displacedStay strong Katy/Houston/Texas 2 ",
