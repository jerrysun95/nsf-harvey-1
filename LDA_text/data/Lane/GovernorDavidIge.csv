A Hurricane Warning is in effect for #Oahu, #Maui County and #Hawaii County. A Hurricane Watch is in effect for #Kauai County.  Maximum sustained winds remain near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher gusts. Lane is a powerful category 4 hurricane. Some weakening is  forecast during the next few days, but Lane is expected to remain a hurricane as it approaches the islands. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km).  WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected on portions of the Big Island beginning early Thursday morning, with hurricane conditions expected in some areas Thursday afternoon or Thursday night.Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin over portions of Maui county on Thursday, with hurricane conditions expected in some areas Thursday night into Friday. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Oahu late Thursday night, with hurricane conditions expected Friday into Friday night. RAINFALL: Rain bands from Hurricane Lane will continue to gradually overspread the Hawaiian Islands tonight and Thursday. Excessive rainfall associated with Lane is expected to affect portions of the Hawaiian Islands from late today into the weekend. This could lead to major flash flooding and landslides. Lane is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 10 to 15 inches with localized amountsin excess of 20 inches over the Hawaiian Islands. SURF: As Lane is slow-moving, large swells generated by Lane will severely impact the Hawaiian Islands over the next couple of days. These swells will produce very large and likely damaging surf along exposed west and south facing shorelines. STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and large breaking waves will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along south and west facing shores near the center of Lane. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area.

As of 11 a.m. today, it is 580 miles southeast of Hilo and 785 miles southeast of Honolulu, traveling in the general direction of the islands. Hurricane Lane may bring tropical-storm-force winds to parts of Hawaii as early as Wednesday morning.

Major flooding and damaging surf can happen even if the eye of the storm doesn‚Äôt pass over the islands. Make sure you are prepared for Hurricane Lane and other natural disasters, with a family emergency plan and an emergency kit (with enough food, water, medication, and other essentials to last at least 14 days).

The HawaiiPay project launched in November 2016 to modernize payroll and time & attendance systems to provide greater functionality and efficiencies in serving approximately 63,000 full- and part-time employees statewide.

One of the greatest ways insure food safety is implemented; I would suggest a Large Packing Shed with USDA Inspectors.  As a young teenager I grew up and worked on large and small farms.  California Farmers have always had USDA at packing sheds to engage with Farmers, and labor to ensure the best produce reaches home across the planet.  Farm Fresh starts with the pickers and tractor drivers delivering to sheds and cold storages.  The faster your produce is delivered to packing shed the less likely to collect harmful bacteria. Packing sheds are designed to kill any harmful bacteria from sitting in the fields.  The care that is taken in the Produce once picked is vital to food safety.  One thing to remember is that Hawaii produce tends to go stale quicker do to the lack of packing sheds and cold storages.  The reason is simple.  Produce that is just picked should leave for treatment and packing followed by cold storage within a couple hours.","Good to hear Governor David Ige!

Hurricane Lane remains a major category 4 storm late this morning, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. As of 11 AM HST, Hurricane Lane was located around 200 miles south-southwest of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii and 275 miles south of Honolulu, Hawaii. Lane is moving toward the northwest at around 7 mph. A slow northward motion is expected to begin this afternoon and continue through Friday. A turn toward thewest is expected Saturday and Sunday, with an increase in forward speed. The latest forecast track from the Central Pacific Hurricane Center brings the center of Lane dangerously close to the main Hawaiian Islands Thursday afternoon through Saturday. Regardless of the exact track, life threatening impacts are likely over many areas as this strong hurricane makes its closest approach. Do not focus onthe exact forecast track or intensity of Lane. Be prepared for changes in future forecasts. Although the official forecast does not explicitly indicate Lane`s center making landfall over any of the islands, this could still occur.Continue reading here http://bit.ly/2MOWmcE Track Lane at http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/#HIGov #HINews","#HurricanLane update as of 11:13AM: No changes to watches and warnings.

Unsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.        - Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater          numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Several          fences and roadway signs blown over.        - Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within          urban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges, causeways,          and access routes impassable.        - Scattered power and communications outages, but more          prevalent in areas with above ground lines.* STORM SURGE    - No storm surge inundation forecast    - POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Little to no storm surge      flooding        - The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the          previous assessment.        - PLAN: There is little to no threat of storm surge flooding.

Small streams,          creeks, canals, arroyos, and ditches may become raging          rivers.

Numerous places where flood waters may cover          escape routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of          raging water with underpasses submerged.

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Hawaii County A Hurricane Watch is in effect for Kauai County...including the islands of Kauai and NiihauMaximum sustained winds are near 120 mph with highergusts. Lane remains a powerful category 3 hurricane with some weakening is forecast from Friday through late Saturday, but Lane is expected to remain ahurricane as it approaches the islands. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles WIND: Tropical storm conditions are already occurring on the Big Island, Maui County and Oahu. These conditions will likely persist through early Friday morning. Hurricane conditions are expected over some areas of Maui County and Oahu starting Friday and continuing through Friday night. Tropical storm or hurricane conditions are possible on Kauai starting late Friday or Friday night. RAINFALL: Rain bands will continue to overspread the Hawaiian Islands well ahead of Lane. Excessive rainfall associated with this slow moving hurricane will continue to impact the Hawaiian Islands into the weekend, leading to significant and life-threatening flash flooding and landslides. Lane is expected to produce total rainaccumulations of 10 to 20 inches, with localized amounts of 30 to 40 inches possible over portions of the Hawaiian Islands. Over two feet of rain has already fallen at a few locations on the windward side of the Big Island. SURF: Very large swells generated by the slow moving hurricane will severely impact the Hawaiian Islands over the next couple of days. These swells will produce extremely large and damaging surf along exposed west and south facing shorelines. A prolonged period of highsurf will likely lead to significant coastal erosion. STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and large breaking waves will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along south and west facing shores near the center of Lane.

Lane is now a Tropical Storm with max winds of 70 mph and still poses a threat for flooding through tomorrow. A Tropical Storm Warning has replaced all Hurricane Warnings. ‚Ä™Lane is 160 miles west of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, and is moving to the northwest at 3 mph.‚Ä¨‚Ä™This northwestward motion is expected through tonight, followed by a westward course Saturday with increasing forward speed. This path will take Lane away from the islands. Regardless of the storm\'s track, life threatening impacts extends far beyond the center\'s location. Do not focus on the exact forecast track or intensity of Lane. ‚Ä¨‚Ä™Tropical storm conditions are already occurring in Maui County and will continue through tonight. ‚Ä¨‚Ä™A slow moving rain band associated with Hurricane Lane continues to affect the island chain this evening. There is the possibility the band will linger over the islands through tonight. Heavy rains and flash flooding are still ongoing especially over windward Haleakala on Maui. Showers have recently been increasing across Molokai. The potential for excessive rainfall remains is high, which could lead to life threatening flash flooding, as well as land and mudslides. Flooding will be possible in areas that are typically not prone to flooding. Although Lane is weakening, it still has the potential to produce rain accumulations of 10 to 20 inches, with localized higher amounts. ‚Ä¨‚Ä™Swells generated by Lane will produce large and life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along shores with a southern exposure. A prolonged period of high surf will likely lead to significant coastal erosion. ‚Ä¨‚Ä™A High Surf Advisory is in effect for the south facing shores of the smaller islands through tonight at 8 to 12 feet. A High Surf Advisory remains in effect for the east facing shores of all islands at 10 to 14 feet through Saturday.‚Ä¨‚Ä™The combination of storm surge and large breaking waves is expected to raise water levels above normal tide levels. This is expected to result in beach erosion and overwash onto vulnerable coastal roadways through Saturday, particularly for vulnerable low-lying coastal areas during and around the time of normal high tide cycles. ‚Ä¨‚Ä™Tornadoes and large waterspouts are still possible with Lane, mainly along and to the right of the track of Lane. ‚Ä¨‚Ä™INFORMATION: Maui County Emergency Management Agency will continue to monitor the situation.

He was allowed to become a Navy pilot. But he was a terrible pilot.McCain crashed two navy Jets in his early career. Then while aboard the Aircraft Carrier USS Forrestal, McCain got angry because he had to wait in line to take off on a bombing run.He shut off his engines, opened the cockpit, and in his haste to exit the aircraft to chew someone out about his having to "" wait"", he hit the button that released his live bombs onto the deck of the Forrestal.He took off running, as the bombs exploded, which set off a chain reaction of bombs from adjacent aircraft, and the ensuing explosions and fires killed 133 sailors aboard the Forrestal.While his fellow sailors were fighting the fire, McCain went to the pilot\'s lounge below decks and watched the men fight the fire on closed circuit TV.Hours later, McCain took off with a New York Times reporter buddy of his, and went on to say that after seeing the effects of those bombs on the Forrestal, he was beginning to question the morality of dropping those bombs on the Viet Cong.McCain was the direct cause of 133 deaths on his own ship, and was never reprimanded. He was nowhere to be found as the Forrestal had to limp to the Philippines for months of repair work.McCain was married then. His wife was stricken with debilitating injuries in an automobile accident. And was hospitalized for more than 5 months. McCain was off gallivanting with anything in a skirt.Upon returning from Vietnam Nam, McCain found his wife was disfigured by her injuries, which included a shattered pelvis, arm, and legs. In order to save her legs, doctors performed 23 surgeries on her, and had to remove significant portions of the bones in her legs, which left he shorter, and unable to walk, and in a wheelchair, she had to use a catheter.McCain was disinterested in his first wife\'s predicament. She had to go through grueling physical therapy to learn to walk again.After McCain left the Navy, he was intent on a career in politics. He and His wife Carol had gotten to know Ronald and Nancy Reagan, and McCain was eager to jump into politics.But he decided he needed a more visually pleasing young woman by his side. He callously divorced Carol, the mother of his three children, and immediately jumped into the sack with new wife Cindy, who was 18 years younger.Upon learning of this, the Reagans were shocked and angered by how he had treated Carol.While campaigning for congress, McCain used pictures of himself posing with Mr. And Mrs. Reagan, but there was no hearty endorsement offered by the Reagans.McCain\'s new young wife was also an heiress to an Arizona Brewing fortune.And let us not forget McCain was one of the Keating 5, who had helped swindle life savings from countless Americans in the Savings and Loan scandal of the 1980\'s. McCain was in it up to his eyeballs.Yet McCain was well-connected in Washington, and parlayed his connections into a seat in the United States Senate.So before the tearful tributes to John McCain, be sure you remember the facts about this self-proclaimed Maverick. The facts do not agree with that portrait of a heroic patriot and great American.With due respect to his family, John McCain was never the great man so many portray him as.I do not wish the man any harm or ill-will. But neither should we allow this false narrative fairy-tale about this scoundrel of a man as he faces his eternal fate. can see what John McCain really is","McCain\'s real legacy is: His father was the Admiral in charge of the Pacific fleet prosecuting the war in Vietnam.Because of this McCain got preferential treatment in the Navy. He was allowed to become a Navy pilot. But he was a terrible pilot.McCain crashed two navy Jets in his early career. Then while aboard the Aircraft Carrier USS Forrestal, McCain got angry because he had to wait in line to take off on a bombing run.He shut off his engines, opened the cockpit, and in his haste to exit the aircraft to chew someone out about his having to "" wait"", he hit the button that released his live bombs onto the deck of the Forrestal.He took off running, as the bombs exploded, which set off a chain reaction of bombs from adjacent aircraft, and the ensuing explosions and fires killed 133 sailors aboard the Forrestal.While his fellow sailors were fighting the fire, McCain went to the pilot\'s lounge below decks and watched the men fight the fire on closed circuit TV.Hours later, McCain took off with a New York Times reporter buddy of his, and went on to say that after seeing the effects of those bombs on the Forrestal, he was beginning to question the morality of dropping those bombs on the Viet Cong.McCain was the direct cause of 133 deaths on his own ship, and was never reprimanded. He was nowhere to be found as the Forrestal had to limp to the Philippines for months of repair work.McCain was married then. His wife was stricken with debilitating injuries in an automobile accident. And was hospitalized for more than 5 months. McCain was off gallivanting with anything in a skirt.Upon returning from Vietnam Nam, McCain found his wife was disfigured by her injuries, which included a shattered pelvis, arm, and legs. In order to save her legs, doctors performed 23 surgeries on her, and had to remove significant portions of the bones in her legs, which left he shorter, and unable to walk, and in a wheelchair, she had to use a catheter.McCain was disinterested in his first wife\'s predicament. She had to go through grueling physical therapy to learn to walk again.After McCain left the Navy, he was intent on a career in politics. He and His wife Carol had gotten to know Ronald and Nancy Reagan, and McCain was eager to jump into politics.But he decided he needed a more visually pleasing young woman by his side. He callously divorced Carol, the mother of his three children, and immediately jumped into the sack with new wife Cindy, who was 18 years younger.Upon learning of this, the Reagans were shocked and angered by how he had treated Carol.While campaigning for congress, McCain used pictures of himself posing with Mr. And Mrs. Reagan, but there was no hearty endorsement offered by the Reagans.McCain\'s new young wife was also an heiress to an Arizona Brewing fortune.And let us not forget McCain was one of the Keating 5, who had helped swindle life savings from countless Americans in the Savings and Loan scandal of the 1980\'s.

Thanks to a public-private partnership spearheaded by the Lieutenant Governor‚Äôs office, the pilot project that began in the Kohala district has expanded to Mililani High School, Mililani Uka and Mililani Waena elementary schools. ‚ÄúThe students and administration of Mililani High School gave ‚ÄòAina Pono high marks,‚Äù said Lt.

In 2016, I announced at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress the launch of the Sustainable Hawai ªi Initiative (http://bit.ly/2k8ABES). In Hawai ªi, our koa- ª≈çhi ªa forests cover nearly half of our islands and provide habitat for forest life and watersheds that produce fresh, clean water for our people. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve committed to protecting 30% of our highest priority watersheds by 2030. Our reefs provide habitat for spectacular marine life, and feed us. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm committed to effectively managing 30% of our nearshore ocean waters by 2030. My commitment to protect our forests and coral reefs is not enough. This past June, I signed into law Senate Bill 2571, now Act 104, banning the sale and distribution of sunscreens that contain oxybenzone and octinoxate which are toxic to coral reefs. We are leading the world in this safe reef movement and I hope it will inspire other states and countries to do the same. We have a responsibility to our land and water and my administration will continue to work to protect them so that they can begin to heel. Will you ask for safe reef sunscreens?#30x30 #HIGov","This confirms what we‚Äôve known all along; protecting Hawai ªi‚Äôs forest will also protect the coral reef ecosystem. In 2016, I announced at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress the launch of the Sustainable Hawai ªi Initiative (http://bit.ly/2k8ABES). In Hawai ªi, our koa- ª≈çhi ªa forests cover nearly half of our islands and provide habitat for forest life and watersheds that produce fresh, clean water for our people. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve committed to protecting 30% of our highest priority watersheds by 2030. Our reefs provide habitat for spectacular marine life, and feed us. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm committed to effectively managing 30% of our nearshore ocean waters by 2030. My commitment to protect our forests and coral reefs is not enough.

And more importantly, a skeptic of the C02 AGW. To my knowledge, the numbers have never added up. And to my dismay, many fellow scientists have abandoned their scientific curiosity by simply adhering to the C02 mantra. I don\'t deny that the earth is getting warmer over the millennia, after all, we are only 10k years out of an ice age that lasted over 100k years(what caused the ice age in the first place?). My fear is that without healthy skepticism from the scientific community, we may miss the other important reasons for climate change. As it is now, we may be undergoing another solar minimum after a very minimal solar maximum. I\'d like to know if this affects earth\'s climate. How about the deciduous forests pumping out large amounts (550 million tons )of isoprenes that react with H20 vapor forming epoxides each year. Does the plastic debris fields in our oceans affect oceanic pH and alter climate? Is there a connection between cosmic rays and cloud formation and climate change?Remember that man creates 30-40 billion tons of C02 each year (the US accounts for 20%) that goes into an atmosphere that already has 3,600 billion tons of C02.  In other words, man creates only 1% or less of all C02 already in our atmosphere.  And terrestial(land) plants absorb 450 billion tons of C02 each year, far greater than what man produces, and it actually only represents 15% of all plant C02 absorption...85% from oceanic photosynthetic lifeforms(or absorption of 2,550 billion tons of C02 each year).  C02 is a very dynamic gas, it is not a stagnant molecule in our environment.Also, the biggest greenhouse gas contributor is water vapor and clouds. Maybe upwards of 90% or more. But we don\'t count water vapor effects. Why is that? It leaves us with only 10% or less for all the other greenhouse gases to affect our ""warming"". Although, without water vapor and clouds, we\'re left with numbers that look alarming but confusing due to such wide ranges... CO2(all 3,600 billion tons) accounts for only 0.9-2.6 points (of that 10%),CH4 causing 0.4-0.9 points(of that 10%) O3 at 0.3-0.7(etc), and others like NOx, CFCs, SF6(sulfur hexafluoride). Hence my skeptism of AGW. Too many questions.","To clarify my position, I\'m a skeptic, not a denier. And more importantly, a skeptic of the C02 AGW. To my knowledge, the numbers have never added up.
