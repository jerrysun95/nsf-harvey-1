A warning is typically issued36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficultor dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should berushed to completion. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possiblewithin the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours beforethe anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Interests in the the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands should monitorthe progress of Hurricane Lane. For storm information specific to your area, please monitorproducts issued by the National Weather Service office inHonolulu Hawaii.  DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK----------------------At 800 AM HST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lane was locatedby satellite and radar imagery near near latitude 17.1 North,longitude 157.6 West. Lane is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph(11 km/h). A turn toward the north-northwest and little change inforward speed is expected today. A turn toward the north isanticipated tonight and Friday, as Lane\'s forward motion slows. Aturn toward the west is expected on Saturday and Sunday, with anincrease in forward speed. On the forecast track, the center of Lanewill move very close to or over the portions of the main Hawaiianislands later today through Friday. Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with highergusts. Lane is a powerful category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-SimpsonHurricane Wind Scale. Steady weakening is forecast during the nextcouple of days. Lane is expected to remain a hurricane as it drawscloser to the islands. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) fromthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140miles (220 km). NOAA buoy 51002 located about 250 miles southwest ofthe Big Island recently reported sustained winds of 71 mph (114km/h) and a gust of 94 mph (151 km/h). The estimated minimum central pressure is 949 mb (28.03 inches).  HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected on portions of the BigIsland beginning later this morning, with hurricane conditionsexpected in some areas by tonight. Tropical storm conditions areexpected to begin over portions of Maui County later today,with hurricane conditions expected in some areas by Friday.Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Oahu latetonight, with hurricane conditions expected Friday into Fridaynight. RAINFALL: Rain bands from Hurricane Lane will continue to overspreadthe Hawaiian Islands. Excessive rainfall associated with Lane willimpact the Hawaiian Islands into the weekend, leading to significantand life-threatening flash flooding and landslides. Lane is expectedto produce total rain accumulations of 10 to 20 inches, withlocalized amounts in excess of 30 inches over the Hawaiian Islands.Over 12 inches of rain has already fallen on portions of the BigIsland. SURF: As Lane is slow-moving, large swells generated by thehurricane  will severely impact the Hawaiian Islands over the nextcouple of days. These swells will produce very large and damagingsurf along exposed west and south facing shorelines. A prolongedperiod of high surf will likely lead to significant coastal erosion. STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and largebreaking waves will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feetabove normal tide levels along south and west facing shores nearthe center of Lane. The surge will be accompanied by large anddestructive waves.Mayor Caldwell and the city’s Department of Emergency Management urges all residents to know the following:Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu. Due to our isolation and large population nearing one million residents it could be many days before local disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14-days. Assemble basic supplies such as food, water, clothing and important medications for a 14-day kit. Also, visit our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.Evacuation Zones:Be aware that if you live on the shoreline or near the ocean you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge. Review coastal evacuation maps in your telephone white pages or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/DEM and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami/hurricane evacuation zone.Emergency Alert System (EAS):Important official emergency information such as evacuation notification and shelter locations will be broadcast over all TV and radio stations statewide using the EAS. Should your power go out during an emergency such as a hurricane, it then becomes vitally important that each household have a battery operated radio and spare batteries on hand to receive emergency information. Newer hand-crank generator or solar powered radios are also a good option. EAS broadcasts for major coastal evacuations will be aired in conjunction with a three-minute sounding of all Outdoor Siren Warning Systems on O‘ahu.Emergency and Community Information via Social Media/Online:Like and Follow the Department of Emergency Management on Twitter at @Oahu_DEM and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/OahuDEM.

Review insurance policies.• Be prepared to bring loose, lightweight objects inside that could become projectiles in high winds (e.g., patio furniture, garbage cans); anchor objects that would be unsafe to bring inside (e.g., propane tanks); and trim or remove trees close enough to fall on the building.• Be prepared to cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” exterior grade or marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install.Check insurance policies:Remember that homeowners insurance alone will not cover hurricane damage. You will need separate policies for hurricane as well as flood insurance to protect against damage from coastal flooding. You can buy flood insurance separately through the National Flood Insurance Program. Make sure to check and know what your existing insurance policies will or will not cover.Non-English Speakers and Disabled:If you have a family member who does not speak English or a family member who, due to a disability cannot receive emergency information readily, we highly recommend forming a core group of family or friends who can assist with translations or providing important emergency information as well as assisting with disaster preparedness actions and if needed, evacuationHurricanes and Tropical Storms:Once a storm system crosses the 140-degree west longitude mark, it enters the Central Pacific area and would be in “Hawaiian” waters.

A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.Interests in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands should monitor the progress of Hurricane Lane.For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by the National Weather Service office in Honolulu Hawaii. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK----------------------At 500 PM HST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Lane was located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 156.5 West. Lane is moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). This motion is expected to continue tonight, with a turn toward the north and a slower forward motion expected on Friday. A turn back toward the west is expected on Saturday. On the forecast track, the center of Lane will move very close to or over the main Hawaiian Islands Thursday and Friday.Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher gusts. Lane is a powerful category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some weakening is forecast during the next few days, but Lane is expected to remain a hurricane as it approaches the islands.Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km).The estimated minimum central pressure is 939 mb (27.73 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected on portions of the Big Island beginning early Thursday morning, with hurricane conditions expected in some areas Thursday afternoon or Thursday night. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin over portions of Maui county on Thursday, with hurricane conditions expected in some areas Thursday night into Friday. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin on Oahu late Thursday night, with hurricane conditions expected Friday.RAINFALL: Rainbands from Hurricane Lane will continue to gradually overspread the state tonight and Thursday. Excessive rainfall associated with Lane is expected to affect portions of the Hawaiian Islands from late today into the weekend. This could lead to major flash flooding and landslides. Lane is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 10 to 15 inches with localized amounts in excess of 20 inches over the Hawaiian Islands.SURF: Large swells generated by Lane will impact the Hawaiian Islands, spreading across the island chain tonight and Thursday. These swells will produce very large and potentially damaging surf along exposed west, south and east facing shorelines.STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and large breaking waves will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along south and west facing shores near the center of Lane. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.Mayor Caldwell and the city’s Department of Emergency Management urges all residents to know the following:Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu. Due to our isolation and large population nearing one million residents it could be many days before local disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14-days.

Also, visit our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.Evacuation Zones:Be aware that if you live on the shoreline or near the ocean you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge.

Additional Tropical Storm or  Hurricane Watches or Warnings may be issued tonight or Wednesday. For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by the National Weather Service office in  Honolulu Hawaii. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK----------------------At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lane was located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 155.3 West. Lane is moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this motion is expected to become northwest later today, followed by a turn to the north-northwest on Thursday. On the forecast track, thecenter of Lane will move very close to or over the main Hawaiian Islands from Thursday through Saturday.Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher gusts. Lane is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but Lane is forecast to remain a dangerous hurricane as it draws closer to the Hawaiian Islands.Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km).The estimated minimum central pressure is 935 mb (27.61 inches).HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within theHurricane Warning area beginning late tonight intoearly Thursday morning, with hurricane conditions expected somewhere within the warning area on Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area beginning Thursday into Thursday night, with hurricane conditions possible late Thursday night into Friday.RAINFALL: Excessive rainfall associated with Lane is expected to affect portions of the Hawaiian Islands from late today into the weekend, leading to flash flooding and landslides. Lane is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 10 to 15 inches with isolated amounts greater than 20 inches over the Hawaiian Islands.SURF: Large swells generated by Lane will impact the Hawaiian Islands, beginning this morning on the Big Island, spreading across the remainder of the island chain on today. These swells will produce large and potentially damaging surf along exposed west, south and east facing shorelines.NEXT ADVISORY-------------Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM HST.Next complete advisory at 1100 AM HST.Mayor Caldwell and the city’s Department of Emergency Management urges all residents to know the following:Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu.

A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm- force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult  or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be  rushed to completion. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before  the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,  conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Interests elsewhere in the main Hawaiian Islands, and across the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, should continue to closely monitor  the progress of Hurricane Lane. Additional Tropical Storm or  Hurricane Watches or Warnings may be issued tonight or Wednesday. For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by the National Weather Service office in  Honolulu Hawaii. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK----------------------At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Lane was located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 155.3 West. Lane is moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this motion is expected to become northwest later today, followed by a turn to the north-northwest on Thursday. On the forecast track, thecenter of Lane will move very close to or over the main Hawaiian Islands from Thursday through Saturday.Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher gusts. Lane is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but Lane is forecast to remain a dangerous hurricane as it draws closer to the Hawaiian Islands.Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km).The estimated minimum central pressure is 935 mb (27.61 inches).HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within theHurricane Warning area beginning late tonight intoearly Thursday morning, with hurricane conditions expected somewhere within the warning area on Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area beginning Thursday into Thursday night, with hurricane conditions possible late Thursday night into Friday.RAINFALL: Excessive rainfall associated with Lane is expected to affect portions of the Hawaiian Islands from late today into the weekend, leading to flash flooding and landslides. Lane is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 10 to 15 inches with isolated amounts greater than 20 inches over the Hawaiian Islands.SURF: Large swells generated by Lane will impact the Hawaiian Islands, beginning this morning on the Big Island, spreading across the remainder of the island chain on today. These swells will produce large and potentially damaging surf along exposed west, south and east facing shorelines.NEXT ADVISORY-------------Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM HST.Next complete advisory at 1100 AM HST.Mayor Caldwell and the city’s Department of Emergency Management urges all residents to know the following:Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu. Due to our isolation and large population nearing one million residents it could be many days before local disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14-days. Assemble basic supplies such as food, water, clothing and important medications for a 14-day kit. Also, visit our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.Evacuation Zones:Be aware that if you live on the shoreline or near the ocean you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge. Review coastal evacuation maps in your telephone white pages or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/DEM and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami/hurricane evacuation zone.Emergency Alert System (EAS):Important official emergency information such as evacuation notification and shelter locations will be broadcast over all TV and radio stations statewide using the EAS. Should your power go out during an emergency such as a hurricane, it then becomes vitally important that each household have a battery operated radio and spare batteries on hand to receive emergency information. Newer hand-crank generator or solar powered radios are also a good option. EAS broadcasts for major coastal evacuations will be aired in conjunction with a three-minute sounding of all Outdoor Siren Warning Systems on O‘ahu.Emergency and Community Information via Social Media/Online:Like and Follow the Department of Emergency Management on Twitter at @Oahu_DEM and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/OahuDEM.

Review insurance policies.• Be prepared to bring loose, lightweight objects inside that could become projectiles in high winds (e.g., patio furniture, garbage cans); anchor objects that would be unsafe to bring inside (e.g., propane tanks); and trim or remove trees close enough to fall on the building.• Be prepared to cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” exterior grade or marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install.Check insurance policies:Remember that homeowners insurance alone will not cover hurricane damage. You will need separate policies for hurricane as well as flood insurance to protect against damage from coastal flooding. You can buy flood insurance separately through the National Flood Insurance Program. Make sure to check and know what your existing insurance policies will or will not cover.Non-English Speakers and Disabled:If you have a family member who does not speak English or a family member who, due to a disability cannot receive emergency information readily, we highly recommend forming a core group of family or friends who can assist with translations or providing important emergency information as well as assisting with disaster preparedness actions and if needed, evacuationHurricanes and Tropical Storms:Once a storm system crosses the 140-degree west longitude mark, it enters the Central Pacific area and would be in “Hawaiian” waters.

The Department of Emergency Management is in the process of assessing sites for hurricane shelters, and a decision on when to open these shelters will be made on Wednesday, August 22. All city employees are being told to report to work until they are told otherwise.“Hurricane Lane remains an extremely dangerous and powerful storm and even if O‘ahu avoids a direct hit, the impact from storm surge, strong winds and prolonged rainfall could be significant,” said Mayor Caldwell. “A decision on the suspension of city services like TheBus, Handi-Van and trash and bulky item pickup will be made once the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issues another update Wednesday at 8 a.m. Just as the city is preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Lane, residents and visitors should be doing the same by compiling a 14-day hurricane kit, preparing their homes against wind and rain, and making sure that relatives and neighbors know what to do.”TheBus and Handi-Van will run on regular weekday schedules on Wednesday, August 22. Meanwhile, residents should continue to place their trash collection bins and bulky items curbside until told to do otherwise.One of the best ways to stay informed about Hurricane Lane is to download the city’s smartphone app, HNL.info, which is also available as a website.

Slow weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but Lane is forecast to remain a dangerous hurricane as it draws closer to the Hawaiian Islands.Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles(220 km).The estimated minimum central pressure is 929 mb (27.44 inches).HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Hurricane Warning area beginning late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning, with hurricane conditions expected somewhere within the warning area on Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area beginning Thursday into Thursday night, with hurricane conditions possible late Thursday night into Friday.RAINFALL: Excessive rainfall associated with Lane is expected to affect portions of the Hawaiian Islands from late Wednesday into the weekend, leading to flash flooding and landslides. Lane is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 10 to 15 inches with isolated amounts greater than 20 inches over the Hawaiian Islands.SURF: Large swells generated by Lane will impact the Hawaiian Islands, beginning tonight on the Big Island, spreading across the remainder of the island chain on Wednesday. These swells will produce large and potentially damaging surf along exposed west, south and east facing shorelines.Mayor Caldwell and the city’s Department of Emergency Management urges all residents to know the following:Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu. Due to our isolation and large population nearing one million residents it could be many days before local disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14-days. Assemble basic supplies such as food, water, clothing and important medications for a 14-day kit. Also, visit our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.Evacuation Zones:Be aware that if you live on the shoreline or near the ocean you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge. Review coastal evacuation maps in your telephone white pages or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/DEM and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami/hurricane evacuation zone.Emergency Alert System (EAS):Important official emergency information such as evacuation notification and shelter locations will be broadcast over all TV and radio stations statewide using the EAS. Should your power go out during an emergency such as a hurricane, it then becomes vitally important that each household have a battery operated radio and spare batteries on hand to receive emergency information. Newer hand-crank generator or solar powered radios are also a good option. EAS broadcasts for major coastal evacuations will be aired in conjunction with a three-minute sounding of all Outdoor Siren Warning Systems on O‘ahu.Emergency and Community Information via Social Media/Online:Like and Follow the Department of Emergency Management on Twitter at @Oahu_DEM and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/OahuDEM. Additional preparedness information can also be found on our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM. Residents are also urged to follow Mayor Caldwell’s social media channels at: Twitter: @MayorKirkHNL; Facebook: facebook.com/MayorKirk; Instagram: instagram.com/mayorkirkhnl; and YouTube: youtube.com/MayorKirkHNL.Emergency Email and Text Message Alerts:O‘ahu residents are encouraged to sign-up to receive emergency email, cellphone text messages and push alerts from the City and County of Honolulu by downloading the free HNL.info app from the App Store or Google Play. You can also register online at https://hnl.info/alerts/login.php HNL.info is also perfect for vacationers and out of town family or guests. Standard text messaging rates may apply depending on your wireless carrier and plan.Preparing your home:• Protect your property. Declutter drains and gutters. Consider hurricane shutters. Review insurance policies.• Be prepared to bring loose, lightweight objects inside that could become projectiles in high winds (e.g., patio furniture, garbage cans); anchor objects that would be unsafe to bring inside (e.g., propane tanks); and trim or remove trees close enough to fall on the building.• Be prepared to cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” exterior grade or marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install.Check insurance policies:Remember that homeowners insurance alone will not cover hurricane damage. You will need separate policies for hurricane as well as flood insurance to protect against damage from coastal flooding. You can buy flood insurance separately through the National Flood Insurance Program. Make sure to check and know what your existing insurance policies will or will not cover.Non-English Speakers and Disabled:If you have a family member who does not speak English or a family member who, due to a disability cannot receive emergency information readily, we highly recommend forming a core group of family or friends who can assist with translations or providing important emergency information as well as assisting with disaster preparedness actions and if needed, evacuationHurricanes and Tropical Storms:Once a storm system crosses the 140-degree west longitude mark, it enters the Central Pacific area and would be in “Hawaiian” waters. Carefully monitor any hurricanes or tropical storms that develop or enter into Hawaiian waters until they safely pass our islands or dissipate.","shared_story","link",21,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

Locations of Public Shelters will be broadcast over local TV and radio.  Public Shelters are for those individuals who do not require hospitalization and should be used as a last resort.  Special health needs evacuees must either be capable of taking care of their own needs or be accompanied by a caregiver.  Recommend planning ahead with family members, friends and / or neighbors to be able to shelter in a home built 1995 or later which can be secured and which is not in a flood or evacuation zone.I am disabled, should I evacuate to a hospital?Unless you have a medical emergency, hospitals will not allow you to shelter there.  Public Shelters are open to accommodate the general public and those with access and/or functional needs.  Locations of Public Shelters will be broadcast over local TV and radio.  Public Shelters are for those individuals who do not require hospitalization and should be used as a last resort.  If you need emergency assistance to evacuate your home call 9-1-1.  Be aware that during an island-wide emergency assistance from Police, Fire and Emergency Medical Services could be delayed or in most cases, unavailable.  Recommend planning ahead to seek the help of family, friends and / or neighbors to assist you with your evacuation, sheltering or disaster assistance needs.I know a disabled person who cannot understand emergency information broadcast over TV and radio.If you know a person who due to a disability cannot receive emergency information readily,  we highly recommend forming a core group of family, friends and / or neighbors who can assist with translations or providing important emergency information as well as assisting with disaster preparedness actions and if needed, such as evacuation.  In addition, we highly recommend signing up to receive emergency push alert messages and / or emails sent directly to your cell phone from the City’s Mobile App, HNL.Info.  This free mobile app is available to download from iTunes App Store and Google Play.  Online web based version at https://hnl.info/alerts.      Will emergency hurricane shelters have medical equipment/supplies to help people needing oxygen, dialysis or other medical health needs?No, Public Shelters do not provide life-sustaining services.  Each person who requires life-sustaining services needs to work out an agreement with the companies that provide these services such as oxygen providers.  The City provides emergency access cards to all companies that provide life-sustaining equipment / services such as oxygen so they can get through roadblocks to deliver such services before a hurricane or storm.  Recommend planning ahead with your provider to make those arrangements before an emergency occurs. Will emergency hurricane shelters have medical equipment/supplies to help people needing oxygen, dialysis or other medical health needs? For dialysis services, the City has been working with the service providers to get some details on their operations. Here are some of their recommendations:1. Dialysis patients have several days between services; if a hurricane is approaching they can go on a special diet to lengthen that period. It is recommended that patients speak to their doctor in advance to discuss their various options during a disaster.2. Dialysis requires power and lots of distilled water; patients should check with their provider if they have an emergency plan which would allow them to operate after a disaster, such as having an emergency generator, fuel and water.3. If providers are unable to provide services after a disaster, the City may turn to FEMA who can assist in temporarily relocating people from affected areas; patients would return when services such as oxygen delivery and dialysis capabilities are restored.BUSINESSESI am a business owner, what should I be doing?All businesses should consider protecting important assets such as files, documents, equipment and any other items necessary to reopen your business following a disaster.  In addition, all businesses should ensure that their employees and families have undertaken disaster preparedness actions at home so that they can return to work as soon as it is safe to do so.  I am an employee, what should I be doing?Contact your employer and ask if there are any specific preparedness actions that your company or business may require.  In addition you should ensure that your family and home are prepared for the emergency.  This includes preparing a disaster supply kit which includes a minimum of 14-days’ worth of non-perishable food, water, clothing, prescription medications, flashlight, portable radio, cash and other important items.  If your family is disaster prepared at home then you will be better able to return to work following an emergency.  (See the section on Preparedness should the caller have specific questions)When will help be available if my business is damaged?County, State and Federal assistance for businesses is generally available sometime following the disaster.  Listen to local TV and radio for updates on disaster relief assistance. CLOSURESWill my child’s school be closed?The decision to close public schools will be made by the Hawaii State Department of Education.  Monitor local TV and radio for updates on school closures.Will the airport be closed?The decision to close airports will be made by the Hawaii State Department of Transportation.  Monitor local TV and radio for updates on airport closures.What roads or highways are closed?Unfortunately during a storm event it is very difficult to know immediately which roads are open or closed.  Police forward road closure information to local media as quickly as possible.  Listen to local TV and radio for the most current updates. In addition, we highly recommend signing up to receive emergency push alert messages or emails sent directly to your cell phone from the City’s Mobile App, HNL.Info.  This free mobile app is available to download from iTunes App Store and Google Play.  Online web based version at https://hnl.info/alerts.      EVACUATIONShould I consider evacuating? You should evacuate immediately when advised by authorities especially if you live in a flood or evacuation zone, on a high ridged area susceptible to high winds, homes built before 1995 with no hardening upgrades done to bring it up to current building codes or you feel that your home or location is no longer safe.  Ultimately, the decision to evacuate is your own, but the protection of you and your family should be the most important consideration.Do you live on or near the shoreline?Yes. Be aware that if you live on the shoreline you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge.   Review coastal evacuation maps in your Hawaiian Telcom telephone book or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/dem and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami evacuation zone at http://cchnl.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=39a9e07068a14d01a85b437adcf50beb.Do you live in an older home?Yes. If you live in an older home (constructed prior to 1995) or an older home on an exposed ridgeline you may have to evacuate.  Older homes are not built to current hurricane construction standards and could be at risk from wind damage.  Homes on exposed ridgelines are extremely susceptible to these hazards.Do you live in a flood prone area?Yes. If you live in an area prone to flooding you should consider evacuating.  Hurricanes and Tropical Storms bring intense amounts of rain that can quickly flood low lying areas causing flash flooding of streams and rivers.  If unsure, check out the State Department of Land and Natural Resources Flood Hazard Assessment Tool online at http://gis.hawaiinfip.org/FHAT/.Do you live in a newly built home or concrete and steel reinforced building located out of the coastal evacuation or flood zones?If yes, you can and should consider sheltering in place in a Safe Room. A Safe Room is a secured room within your home or business with few or no windows.  Bathrooms, large walk in closets and enclosed hallways are ideal.  You want to place as much protection between yourself and the hazards outside your walls.  Bring in pets, close and seal all doors and window coverings.  Move your family, disaster supplies and pets into your Safe Room.  Be sure to take a battery operated radio, flashlight and spare batteries with you.  Remain in your Safe Room until the all clear is issued over local TV and radio.  There will be no siren sounding for an all clear. When should I evacuate?Evacuate immediately when directed by emergency officials.  Evacuation notifications will be broadcast over local TV and radio in conjunction with activation of our island-wide Outdoor Warning Siren system.  Police, Fire, and Emergency Management officials will also use mobile public address systems to alert residents in Oahu neighborhoods.  Plan to complete evacuation before the arrival of sustained 40 MPH winds.  Evacuating in winds exceeding the sustained 40 MPH level may be more hazardous than remaining where you are.Where should I go if I evacuate?Go to the homes of friends or relatives whose residence are not endangered, to facilities provided by your employer or church group, or as a last resort to a public shelter.  Please note that shelters will not be opened automatically.  Monitor local TV and radio for specific shelter locations and opening schedules. Be aware that steel reinforced concrete buildings should provide adequate protection.  If your building is multiple floors and / or is located in the coastal evacuation zone seek safety by moving to higher floors.    Search out enclosed rooms, hallways, or emergency stairwells that have load-bearing walls and no windows.  Such areas offer protection as good as public shelters.I do not drive or have a car, how do I evacuate to a shelter?If you are able to walk or bike, we encourage you to do so.  If not, on Oahu, City buses may be used as evacuation shuttles providing free transportation to the nearest shelter once evacuations are ordered.  These will display a special “Evacuation” sign and will pick you up free anywhere along their route.  Just flag down an evacuation shuttle and get on board.   You do not need to be at a bus stop.Riders will be allowed one bag per person.  Domestic pets may also be brought onboard the bus as long as they are on a leash or in a leak proof solid sided or cage type carrier.  Buses are wheelchair and other mobility device friendly and accessible.When evacuation buses are made available routes and other information will be broadcast over local TV and radio.Request the assistance of family, friends or neighbors to get you to an evacuation shelter site. GENERAL PREPAREDNESSFourteen (14)-day Emergency Supply KitWith Hawaii’s remoteness it could be as long as two weeks or more before a full disaster relief operation can be initiated.  Hawaii residents need to be prepared to take care of all of their emergency needs and those of their family for at least 14-days following a major island or state-wide disaster. Your emergency supplies kit should contain enough of the following items to last for a minimum of 14-days:Water - One gallon of water per person per day for drinking, cooking and sanitation (1/2 gallon per person per day for drinking purposes only).Food - Non-perishable food that does not require cooking such as chunky peanut butter, protein/nutrient bars, protein shakes and/or dried fruits/nuts.  Popular local foods such as spam, corned beef and vienna sausages are great comfort foods but contain high sodium and may be heavy to carry should you need evacuate.Eating Utensils – Plates, mess kits, forks and chop sticks.  Don’t forget a non-electric can opener for canned foods.Radio – NOAA Weather Radio or AM/FM Radio (battery, hand-crank or solar) Light - Flashlight (battery, hand-crank or solar) and / or portable fluorescent lightsSpare batteries - Check annually (keep batteries out of radios and flashlights and in a dry area to avoid corrosion).First Aid – Get a good kit with non-latex gloves and consider enrolling in a certified first aid, CPR and AED course.Whistle – Important for signaling for help.  A whistle carries much farther than the human voice and uses less energy than yelling.Dust Mask – Helps to filter contaminated air.Sanitation - Moist towelettes, toilet paper, baby wipes, 5-gallon bucket (if need to evacuate), heavy duty garbage bags, baking soda or kitty litter to absorb odors and plastic ties for personal sanitation.Personal Toiletry – Baby wipes, mouth wash, tooth paste/brush, deodorant, feminine products, incontinent supplies.Tools - Wrench or pliers to turn off utilities, duct tape, rope.Important Document - Picture ID, Medical Records, Insurance and Bank Records, Certificates (i.e. Birth, Marriage, Divorce), Deeds, Wills and Healthcare Directives, Family Photos, Local area maps. (Download the FEMA Emergency Financial First Aid Kit https://bit.ly/2Pcvwtl )Medication and Prescription – Special medications, spare glasses, hearing aid batteries, listing of all prescriptions and medical device serial numbers.Baby and Children - Infant formula, diapers, kid friendly snacks, toys and games that do not require power or batteries.Pet Supplies - Pet food, water, leak proof crate / container, leash, ID, medications, and toy. How do I prepare for high winds? • Trim dead wood and weak/overhanging branches from all trees.  Trimming and maintaining trees and brushes in advance is key as you want to avoid recently cut trimmings to become projectiles during a high wind event.• Certain trees and bushes are vulnerable to high winds and any dead tree near a home can become a hazard.  Consider investing the time and/or money to remove such hazards from your property.• Investing in some type of protection for your home’s glass windows and doors such as treated ply wood, storm panels, etc.  If you purchase treated ply wood, recommend you pre-measure, pre-cut and pre-drill and label each panel covering (i.e. Downstairs Bedroom, Panel 1 of 2).  Refer to the U.H. Manoa Sea Grant Homeowner’s Handbook to Prepare for Natural Hazards available online (http://seagrant.soest.hawaii.edu/homeowners-handbook-prepare-natural-hazards).• For homes built before 1995, investing in hurricane clips and straps to secure your roof to the support beams down through the foundation of the home is recommended.  Refer to the U.H. Manoa Sea Grant Homeowner’s Handbook to Prepare for Natural Hazards available online (http://seagrant.soest.hawaii.edu/homeowners-handbook-prepare-natural-hazards).• Know where to secure lawn furniture, trash cans and other unsecured outside objects that could become projectiles in high winds (i.e. Bring them into your home or garage or for heavier items consider corralling them up by tying them together and securing them.)• Detached carports and open garages are at risk from high wind damage. Consider adding strapping to secure carports.• Have flashlights, battery operated radio and spare batteries on-hand in case of a power outage.• Drivers of large trucks and SUV’s should be prepared for sudden gusts of wind which could cause momentary loss of vehicle control.  Stay off roads if at all possible.• Listen to local TV and radio for safety instructions from the Department of Emergency Management and the National Weather Service.  • Should you have a high wind related emergency call 9-1-1 immediately.What do I need to do before a hurricane or tropical storm strikes?• Have major electronics moved off the ground, unplugged or plugged in a surge protector strips.• Backup important electronic files onto an external drive or cloud regularly.• Have mobile cell phones charged and have an external charger for each.• Keep your family together if possible and minimize travel until the storm system is no longer a threat.• Make plans to secure your property. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install. Tape does not prevent windows from breaking.• Be sure trees and shrubs around your home are well trimmed.• Remove and safely store any items outdoors such a lawn furniture that could become airborne.• Clear loose and clogged rain gutters and downspouts.• Determine how and where to secure your boat if you own one.• Consider building or identifying a safe room in your home where you can shelter in place.  • Do not leave your windows open at all.  They should remain shut with drapes securely closed.Should I tape my windows?Masking tape or duct tape on your windows will not stop storm driven debris from breaking the glass.  The only reliable method for securing your windows from damage is to shield them from the outside with plywood (minimum 5/8” thick), window shutters or other window protection systems.Should I open my windows to keep the air pressure from damaging my home?Definitely not.  This is an old urban legend that will not protect your home during a hurricane or tropical storm.  Keeping all of your doors and windows closed and secured is the only way to prevent storm winds and rains from entering the structure and causing damage or catastrophic failure.How can I get emergency information? The State of Hawaii has a robust Outdoor Warning Siren System; however, with population and development growth more sirens are being planned to be installed; however, the Outdoor Warning Siren System is just one way to receive emergency alerts.  It is strongly recommended to have multiple methods of receiving emergency information. These methods include:• Local TV and Radio Broadcasts• Emergency Alert System (EAS) message notifications broadcast over local TV, Radio and NOAA AM/FM Weather Radio• Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system by having it set in the “On” mode on Smart Phone devices• NOAA AM/FM Weather Radio with Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME)• HNL.info push alerts/email/SMS text messaging via app download from the App Store or Google Play Store or via online registration at https://hnl.info/alerts/register.php (Each County has their own local notification system.

What does that mean and what should I do?A Hurricane/Tropical Storm WARNING means that the hurricane/tropical storm conditions of high winds and storm surge are possible in the specified area of the WARNING, usually within 36-hours. Think of a WARENING as an alert to TAKE ACTION.  When a WARNING is issued residents should:• Be prepared to evacuate if ordered to do so, especially if you live in:o The Coastal Evacuation Zone – Consult the Hawaiian Telcom telephone book evacuation maps or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/dem and click on the Tsunami Map Viewer link at http://cchnl.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=39a9e07068a14d01a85b437adcf50beb.  Hurricane storm surge evacuation zones are similar to the Tsunami Evacuation Zone delineated in Red and outlined with a solid black line.o Flood Zones (http://gis.hawaiinfip.org/FHAT/)o Older homes (built pre-1995) on exposed ridgelines and on mountain slopes.o Older “plantation” style single wall homes without foundations and pier and post foundations regardless of where they are located.• Complete any unfinished hurricane WATCH actions.• Follow emergency instructions issued by emergency management or public safety officials.• Notify family, friends and neighbors outside of the area of your evacuation plans so you can re-establish contact after a storm.A  Flash Flood Advisory/Watch/Warning was just broadcast.  What does that mean?Flood Advisory A Flood Advisory means nuisance flooding is occurring or imminent. A Flood Advisory may be upgraded to a Flash Flood Warning if flooding worsens and poses a threat to life and property.  Closely monitor local TV and radio for more information.   Flash Flood Watch A Flash Flood Watch means heavy rain leading to flash flooding is possible. If you are in the area of a flash flood watch you should be prepared for heavy rains and flooding that may develop. Flash Flood Watches may be issued up to 12 hours before flash flooding is expected to begin and may last as long as 48 hours.  Continue to closely monitor local TV and radio for more information.   Flash Flood Warning This means that flash flooding is occurring or will develop quickly somewhere within the designated area.  If your area is identified in a Flash Flood Warning you must take shelter or evacuate to high ground immediately especially if you reside in a flood prone area or near streams and rivers. Closely monitor local TV and radio for more information on flooded areas and public shelters that may be open for evacuees. When evacuating DO NOT drive through flooded areas in your vehicle as parts of the road may already be washed out or the water may be much deeper than it appears.  Turn around, don’t drown!WEATHER RELATEDHow can I get current weather information?Call the National Weather Service at 808-973-4380 for recorded weather information or visit their website at www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/.

POST DISASTER RELIEFWhen will help be available if my home is damaged or destroyed?Due to our large population, post disaster relief assistance could take as long as a week to reach everyone on Oahu needing help.  Evacuation shelters will remain open as long as there is a need.  Disaster Assistance and Recovery Centers (DARCs) will open in affected communities following a major disaster.  At DARCs residents can access disaster relief resources of City, State, Federal and non-government agencies all in one place.Listen to local TV and radio for updates on post disaster relief assistance, shelter updates and opening schedules for DARCs. EMERGENCY ASSISTANCEI have an emergency, what do I do?Call 9-1-1. If I need emergency assistance to evacuate what do I do?If you need emergency assistance to evacuate your home call 9-1-1.  Be aware that during an island-wide emergency many people on Oahu will be calling for assistance from Police, Fire and Emergency Medical Services.  Emergency assistance could be delayed or in some cases, unavailable especially if streets or highways are impassable.  You should seek the assistance of friends or family members to help you with your evacuation, sheltering or disaster assistance needs.","Hurricane and Tropical Storm FAQsACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS I am disabled or have a family member who is disabled, where can I go?Public Shelters are open to accommodate the general public and those with access and/or functional needs.  Locations of Public Shelters will be broadcast over local TV and radio.  Public Shelters are for those individuals who do not require hospitalization and should be used as a last resort.  Special health needs evacuees must either be capable of taking care of their own needs or be accompanied by a caregiver.  Recommend planning ahead with family members, friends and / or neighbors to be able to shelter in a home built 1995 or later which can be secured and which is not in a flood or evacuation zone.I am disabled, should I evacuate to a hospital?Unless you have a medical emergency, hospitals will not allow you to shelter there.  Public Shelters are open to accommodate the general public and those with access and/or functional needs.  Locations of Public Shelters will be broadcast over local TV and radio.  Public Shelters are for those individuals who do not require hospitalization and should be used as a last resort.  If you need emergency assistance to evacuate your home call 9-1-1.  Be aware that during an island-wide emergency assistance from Police, Fire and Emergency Medical Services could be delayed or in most cases, unavailable.  Recommend planning ahead to seek the help of family, friends and / or neighbors to assist you with your evacuation, sheltering or disaster assistance needs.I know a disabled person who cannot understand emergency information broadcast over TV and radio.If you know a person who due to a disability cannot receive emergency information readily,  we highly recommend forming a core group of family, friends and / or neighbors who can assist with translations or providing important emergency information as well as assisting with disaster preparedness actions and if needed, such as evacuation.  In addition, we highly recommend signing up to receive emergency push alert messages and / or emails sent directly to your cell phone from the City’s Mobile App, HNL.Info.  This free mobile app is available to download from iTunes App Store and Google Play.  Online web based version at https://hnl.info/alerts.      Will emergency hurricane shelters have medical equipment/supplies to help people needing oxygen, dialysis or other medical health needs?No, Public Shelters do not provide life-sustaining services.  Each person who requires life-sustaining services needs to work out an agreement with the companies that provide these services such as oxygen providers.  The City provides emergency access cards to all companies that provide life-sustaining equipment / services such as oxygen so they can get through roadblocks to deliver such services before a hurricane or storm.  Recommend planning ahead with your provider to make those arrangements before an emergency occurs. Will emergency hurricane shelters have medical equipment/supplies to help people needing oxygen, dialysis or other medical health needs? For dialysis services, the City has been working with the service providers to get some details on their operations. Here are some of their recommendations:1. Dialysis patients have several days between services; if a hurricane is approaching they can go on a special diet to lengthen that period. It is recommended that patients speak to their doctor in advance to discuss their various options during a disaster.2. Dialysis requires power and lots of distilled water; patients should check with their provider if they have an emergency plan which would allow them to operate after a disaster, such as having an emergency generator, fuel and water.3. If providers are unable to provide services after a disaster, the City may turn to FEMA who can assist in temporarily relocating people from affected areas; patients would return when services such as oxygen delivery and dialysis capabilities are restored.BUSINESSESI am a business owner, what should I be doing?All businesses should consider protecting important assets such as files, documents, equipment and any other items necessary to reopen your business following a disaster.  In addition, all businesses should ensure that their employees and families have undertaken disaster preparedness actions at home so that they can return to work as soon as it is safe to do so.  I am an employee, what should I be doing?Contact your employer and ask if there are any specific preparedness actions that your company or business may require.  In addition you should ensure that your family and home are prepared for the emergency.  This includes preparing a disaster supply kit which includes a minimum of 14-days’ worth of non-perishable food, water, clothing, prescription medications, flashlight, portable radio, cash and other important items.  If your family is disaster prepared at home then you will be better able to return to work following an emergency.  (See the section on Preparedness should the caller have specific questions)When will help be available if my business is damaged?County, State and Federal assistance for businesses is generally available sometime following the disaster.  Listen to local TV and radio for updates on disaster relief assistance. CLOSURESWill my child’s school be closed?The decision to close public schools will be made by the Hawaii State Department of Education.  Monitor local TV and radio for updates on school closures.Will the airport be closed?The decision to close airports will be made by the Hawaii State Department of Transportation.  Monitor local TV and radio for updates on airport closures.What roads or highways are closed?Unfortunately during a storm event it is very difficult to know immediately which roads are open or closed.  Police forward road closure information to local media as quickly as possible.  Listen to local TV and radio for the most current updates. In addition, we highly recommend signing up to receive emergency push alert messages or emails sent directly to your cell phone from the City’s Mobile App, HNL.Info.  This free mobile app is available to download from iTunes App Store and Google Play.  Online web based version at https://hnl.info/alerts.      EVACUATIONShould I consider evacuating? You should evacuate immediately when advised by authorities especially if you live in a flood or evacuation zone, on a high ridged area susceptible to high winds, homes built before 1995 with no hardening upgrades done to bring it up to current building codes or you feel that your home or location is no longer safe.  Ultimately, the decision to evacuate is your own, but the protection of you and your family should be the most important consideration.Do you live on or near the shoreline?Yes. Be aware that if you live on the shoreline you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge.   Review coastal evacuation maps in your Hawaiian Telcom telephone book or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/dem and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami evacuation zone at http://cchnl.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=39a9e07068a14d01a85b437adcf50beb.Do you live in an older home?Yes. If you live in an older home (constructed prior to 1995) or an older home on an exposed ridgeline you may have to evacuate.  Older homes are not built to current hurricane construction standards and could be at risk from wind damage.  Homes on exposed ridgelines are extremely susceptible to these hazards.Do you live in a flood prone area?Yes. If you live in an area prone to flooding you should consider evacuating.  Hurricanes and Tropical Storms bring intense amounts of rain that can quickly flood low lying areas causing flash flooding of streams and rivers.  If unsure, check out the State Department of Land and Natural Resources Flood Hazard Assessment Tool online at http://gis.hawaiinfip.org/FHAT/.Do you live in a newly built home or concrete and steel reinforced building located out of the coastal evacuation or flood zones?If yes, you can and should consider sheltering in place in a Safe Room. A Safe Room is a secured room within your home or business with few or no windows.  Bathrooms, large walk in closets and enclosed hallways are ideal.  You want to place as much protection between yourself and the hazards outside your walls.  Bring in pets, close and seal all doors and window coverings.  Move your family, disaster supplies and pets into your Safe Room.  Be sure to take a battery operated radio, flashlight and spare batteries with you.  Remain in your Safe Room until the all clear is issued over local TV and radio.  There will be no siren sounding for an all clear. When should I evacuate?Evacuate immediately when directed by emergency officials.  Evacuation notifications will be broadcast over local TV and radio in conjunction with activation of our island-wide Outdoor Warning Siren system.  Police, Fire, and Emergency Management officials will also use mobile public address systems to alert residents in Oahu neighborhoods.  Plan to complete evacuation before the arrival of sustained 40 MPH winds.  Evacuating in winds exceeding the sustained 40 MPH level may be more hazardous than remaining where you are.Where should I go if I evacuate?Go to the homes of friends or relatives whose residence are not endangered, to facilities provided by your employer or church group, or as a last resort to a public shelter.  Please note that shelters will not be opened automatically.  Monitor local TV and radio for specific shelter locations and opening schedules. Be aware that steel reinforced concrete buildings should provide adequate protection.  If your building is multiple floors and / or is located in the coastal evacuation zone seek safety by moving to higher floors.    Search out enclosed rooms, hallways, or emergency stairwells that have load-bearing walls and no windows.  Such areas offer protection as good as public shelters.I do not drive or have a car, how do I evacuate to a shelter?If you are able to walk or bike, we encourage you to do so.  If not, on Oahu, City buses may be used as evacuation shuttles providing free transportation to the nearest shelter once evacuations are ordered.  These will display a special “Evacuation” sign and will pick you up free anywhere along their route.  Just flag down an evacuation shuttle and get on board.   You do not need to be at a bus stop.Riders will be allowed one bag per person.  Domestic pets may also be brought onboard the bus as long as they are on a leash or in a leak proof solid sided or cage type carrier.  Buses are wheelchair and other mobility device friendly and accessible.When evacuation buses are made available routes and other information will be broadcast over local TV and radio.Request the assistance of family, friends or neighbors to get you to an evacuation shelter site. GENERAL PREPAREDNESSFourteen (14)-day Emergency Supply KitWith Hawaii’s remoteness it could be as long as two weeks or more before a full disaster relief operation can be initiated.  Hawaii residents need to be prepared to take care of all of their emergency needs and those of their family for at least 14-days following a major island or state-wide disaster. Your emergency supplies kit should contain enough of the following items to last for a minimum of 14-days:Water - One gallon of water per person per day for drinking, cooking and sanitation (1/2 gallon per person per day for drinking purposes only).Food - Non-perishable food that does not require cooking such as chunky peanut butter, protein/nutrient bars, protein shakes and/or dried fruits/nuts.  Popular local foods such as spam, corned beef and vienna sausages are great comfort foods but contain high sodium and may be heavy to carry should you need evacuate.Eating Utensils – Plates, mess kits, forks and chop sticks.  Don’t forget a non-electric can opener for canned foods.Radio – NOAA Weather Radio or AM/FM Radio (battery, hand-crank or solar) Light - Flashlight (battery, hand-crank or solar) and / or portable fluorescent lightsSpare batteries - Check annually (keep batteries out of radios and flashlights and in a dry area to avoid corrosion).First Aid – Get a good kit with non-latex gloves and consider enrolling in a certified first aid, CPR and AED course.Whistle – Important for signaling for help.  A whistle carries much farther than the human voice and uses less energy than yelling.Dust Mask – Helps to filter contaminated air.Sanitation - Moist towelettes, toilet paper, baby wipes, 5-gallon bucket (if need to evacuate), heavy duty garbage bags, baking soda or kitty litter to absorb odors and plastic ties for personal sanitation.Personal Toiletry – Baby wipes, mouth wash, tooth paste/brush, deodorant, feminine products, incontinent supplies.Tools - Wrench or pliers to turn off utilities, duct tape, rope.Important Document - Picture ID, Medical Records, Insurance and Bank Records, Certificates (i.e. Birth, Marriage, Divorce), Deeds, Wills and Healthcare Directives, Family Photos, Local area maps. (Download the FEMA Emergency Financial First Aid Kit https://bit.ly/2Pcvwtl )Medication and Prescription – Special medications, spare glasses, hearing aid batteries, listing of all prescriptions and medical device serial numbers.Baby and Children - Infant formula, diapers, kid friendly snacks, toys and games that do not require power or batteries.Pet Supplies - Pet food, water, leak proof crate / container, leash, ID, medications, and toy. How do I prepare for high winds? • Trim dead wood and weak/overhanging branches from all trees.  Trimming and maintaining trees and brushes in advance is key as you want to avoid recently cut trimmings to become projectiles during a high wind event.• Certain trees and bushes are vulnerable to high winds and any dead tree near a home can become a hazard.  Consider investing the time and/or money to remove such hazards from your property.• Investing in some type of protection for your home’s glass windows and doors such as treated ply wood, storm panels, etc.  If you purchase treated ply wood, recommend you pre-measure, pre-cut and pre-drill and label each panel covering (i.e. Downstairs Bedroom, Panel 1 of 2).  Refer to the U.H. Manoa Sea Grant Homeowner’s Handbook to Prepare for Natural Hazards available online (http://seagrant.soest.hawaii.edu/homeowners-handbook-prepare-natural-hazards).• For homes built before 1995, investing in hurricane clips and straps to secure your roof to the support beams down through the foundation of the home is recommended.  Refer to the U.H. Manoa Sea Grant Homeowner’s Handbook to Prepare for Natural Hazards available online (http://seagrant.soest.hawaii.edu/homeowners-handbook-prepare-natural-hazards).• Know where to secure lawn furniture, trash cans and other unsecured outside objects that could become projectiles in high winds (i.e. Bring them into your home or garage or for heavier items consider corralling them up by tying them together and securing them.)• Detached carports and open garages are at risk from high wind damage. Consider adding strapping to secure carports.• Have flashlights, battery operated radio and spare batteries on-hand in case of a power outage.• Drivers of large trucks and SUV’s should be prepared for sudden gusts of wind which could cause momentary loss of vehicle control.  Stay off roads if at all possible.• Listen to local TV and radio for safety instructions from the Department of Emergency Management and the National Weather Service.  • Should you have a high wind related emergency call 9-1-1 immediately.What do I need to do before a hurricane or tropical storm strikes?• Have major electronics moved off the ground, unplugged or plugged in a surge protector strips.• Backup important electronic files onto an external drive or cloud regularly.• Have mobile cell phones charged and have an external charger for each.• Keep your family together if possible and minimize travel until the storm system is no longer a threat.• Make plans to secure your property. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install. Tape does not prevent windows from breaking.• Be sure trees and shrubs around your home are well trimmed.• Remove and safely store any items outdoors such a lawn furniture that could become airborne.• Clear loose and clogged rain gutters and downspouts.• Determine how and where to secure your boat if you own one.• Consider building or identifying a safe room in your home where you can shelter in place.  • Do not leave your windows open at all.  They should remain shut with drapes securely closed.Should I tape my windows?Masking tape or duct tape on your windows will not stop storm driven debris from breaking the glass.  The only reliable method for securing your windows from damage is to shield them from the outside with plywood (minimum 5/8” thick), window shutters or other window protection systems.Should I open my windows to keep the air pressure from damaging my home?Definitely not.  This is an old urban legend that will not protect your home during a hurricane or tropical storm.  Keeping all of your doors and windows closed and secured is the only way to prevent storm winds and rains from entering the structure and causing damage or catastrophic failure.How can I get emergency information? The State of Hawaii has a robust Outdoor Warning Siren System; however, with population and development growth more sirens are being planned to be installed; however, the Outdoor Warning Siren System is just one way to receive emergency alerts.  It is strongly recommended to have multiple methods of receiving emergency information. These methods include:• Local TV and Radio Broadcasts• Emergency Alert System (EAS) message notifications broadcast over local TV, Radio and NOAA AM/FM Weather Radio• Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system by having it set in the “On” mode on Smart Phone devices• NOAA AM/FM Weather Radio with Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME)• HNL.info push alerts/email/SMS text messaging via app download from the App Store or Google Play Store or via online registration at https://hnl.info/alerts/register.php (Each County has their own local notification system.  HNL.info is only for Honolulu.)• Public Address Systems broadcast by local emergency respondersIn addition, consider a 2-way Family Radio Service (FRS) radio or acquiring an Amateur (HAM) Radio License to not only be able to receive emergency information but to be able to communicate emergency information.  HAM Radio is the communication system that the Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) and the Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES) along with the City and State Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Services (RACES) utilizes when landlines and cell phones are inoperable. Local TV and Radio BroadcastingEmergency information such as evacuation instructions may be issued over the Emergency Alert System (EAS) via TV and Radio.  Radio Stations include but are not limited to the following:• KSSK AM 590 / FM 92.3• KZOO AM 1210 (Japanese Language Station)• KREA AM 1540 (Korean Language Station)• KNDI AM 1270 (Multi-Cultural Language Station to include: Ilocano, Tagalog, Hispanic, Cantonese, Mandarin, Laotian, Okinawan, Vietnamese, Samoan, Tongan, Marshallese, Chuukese, Pohnpeian, and English)Disaster Preparedness, what should I know?Due to Hawaii’s isolation and our large resident, military and visitor population it could be many days before disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.  Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14 days.  Assemble basic supplies such as non-perishable food, water, clothing and important medications.   Go to the DEM website at www.honolulu.gov/dem for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.I hear that heavy rains may cause flooding.  What should I do to prepare?• Know the meanings and effects of National Weather Service issued messages of Flood Advisory, Flash Flood Watch and Flash Flood Warning.  Visit the National Weather Service on-line at http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/ for more information and current weather advisory status.  Call the National Weather Service at 808-973-4380 for recorded weather information, and monitor local TV and radio for the latest updates.• Learn the safest evacuation route from your home or place of business to high ground should you have to evacuate in a hurry.• If your area floods frequently, keep emergency materials on hand such as sandbags, plywood, plastic sheeting or tarp, and lumber. • Stay away from areas along streams or near drainage canals/ditches.  These areas can become deadly during periods of heavy rainfall.• If your car stalls in a flooded area, abandon it as soon as possible. Floodwaters can rise rapidly and sweep a car (and its occupants) away. Many deaths have resulted from attempts to move stalled vehicles.  DO NOT drive through flooded areas in your vehicle as parts of the road may already be washed out or the water may be much deeper than it appears.  Turn around, don’t drown!• Consider canceling or postponing outdoor activities especially hiking in mountains and valleys.  A small stream can become a raging torrent within minutes if previous rainfall has been substantial.  Don’t cross until the flash flood subsides.• Heavy rains cause runoff, which attracts more sharks. Avoid swimming immediately after a heavy storm, especially in murky waters.• If you experience a flood related emergency call 9-1-1 immediately!

Flash Flood Watch A Flash Flood Watch means heavy rain leading to flash flooding is possible. If you are in the area of a flash flood watch you should be prepared for heavy rains and flooding that may develop. Flash Flood Watches may be issued up to 12 hours before flash flooding is expected to begin and may last as long as 48 hours.  Continue to closely monitor local TV and radio for more information.   Flash Flood Warning This means that flash flooding is occurring or will develop quickly somewhere within the designated area.  If your area is identified in a Flash Flood Warning you must take shelter or evacuate to high ground immediately especially if you reside in a flood prone area or near streams and rivers. Closely monitor local TV and radio for more information on flooded areas and public shelters that may be open for evacuees. When evacuating DO NOT drive through flooded areas in your vehicle as parts of the road may already be washed out or the water may be much deeper than it appears.  Turn around, don’t drown!WEATHER RELATEDHow can I get current weather information?Call the National Weather Service at 808-973-4380 for recorded weather information or visit their website at www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/.

Carefully monitor any hurricanes or tropical storms that develop or enter into Hawaiian waters until they safely pass our islands or dissipate.","Mayor asks residents and visitors to remain vigilant as Hurricane Hector approaches Hawai‘iHonolulu — After leading a briefing today with the heads of various city departments and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center at the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Mayor Kirk Caldwell is asking O‘ahu residents and visitors to remain vigilant as Hurricane Hector approaches Hawai‘i.“The Central Pacific Hurricane Center forecasts Hurricane Hector will pass south of Hawai‘i Island Tuesday evening to Wednesday morning, and although the current track keeps the storm offshore, any change to a more northerly track could cause significant impacts to O‘ahu and the rest of the Hawaiian islands,” said Mayor Caldwell. “I’m asking our residents and visitors to continue to track Hurricane Hector as it makes its way westward, and to make sure their 14-day hurricane kits are ready and families know what to do should the storm take an unexpected turn.”The Hurricane Hector forecast by the National Weather Service has remained consistent. This provides a degree of confidence that the current track will hold, however it’s important for residents to stay alert.Mayor Caldwell will lead another briefing at the city EOC Tuesday morning at 8 a.m.Residents and visitors can track Hurricane Hector directly by visiting the Central Pacific Hurricane Center website: http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/Ahead of Hurricane Hector’s approach the Department of Facility Maintenance is checking streams and channels for possible blockages, including boulder basins that help catch large debris and sediment during heavy rain events.Meanwhile, the Department of Parks and Recreation wants to remind residents and visitors that if shelters were to open, they will be pet-friendly as long as animals are properly secured and don’t pose a danger to other people. Should Hurricane Hector pose a threat to O‘ahu, the Department of Transportation Services will utilize city buses to ferry residents to shelters, including those who are houseless by working closely with Office of Housing Executive Director Marc Alexander and local service providers.The Department of Emergency Management is also in communication with the O‘ahu Visitors Bureau and the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority to ensure visitors are prepared. While visitors should not cancel their plans, they should be aware of Hurricane Hector’s approach to the Hawaiian islands. It’s incumbent on our visitors to pay attention to warnings issued by local media and government sources, as well as keeping up to date with any announcements made by the O‘ahu Visitors Bureau and the Hawai’i Tourism Authority.Mayor Caldwell and the city’s Department of Emergency Management urge all residents to know the following:Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu. Due to our isolation and large population nearing one million residents it could be many days before local disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14-days. Assemble basic supplies such as food, water, clothing and important medications for a 14-day kit. Also, visit our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.Evacuation Zones:Be aware that if you live on the shoreline or near the ocean you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge. Review coastal evacuation maps in your telephone white pages or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/DEM and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami/hurricane evacuation zone.Emergency Alert System (EAS):Important official emergency information such as evacuation notification and shelter locations will be broadcast over all TV and radio stations statewide using the EAS. Should your power go out during an emergency such as a hurricane, it then becomes vitally important that each household have a battery operated radio and spare batteries on hand to receive emergency information. Newer hand-crank generator or solar powered radios are also a good option. EAS broadcasts for major coastal evacuations will be aired in conjunction with a three-minute sounding of all Outdoor Siren Warning Systems on O‘ahu.Emergency and Community Information via Social Media/Online:Like and Follow the Department of Emergency Management on Twitter at @Oahu_DEM and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/OahuDEM. Additional preparedness information can also be found on our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM. Residents are also urged to follow Mayor Caldwell’s social media channels at: Twitter: @MayorKirkHNL; Facebook: www.facebook.com/MayorKirk; Instagram: instagram.com/mayorkirkhnl; and YouTube: youtube.com/MayorKirkHNL.Emergency Email and Text Message Alerts:O‘ahu residents are encouraged to sign-up to receive emergency email, cellphone text messages and push alerts from the City and County of Honolulu by downloading the free HNL.info app from the App Store or Google Play. You can also register online at https://hnl.info/alerts/login.php HNL.info is also perfect for vacationers and out of town family or guests. Standard text messaging rates may apply depending on your wireless carrier and plan.Preparing your home:• Protect your property. Declutter drains and gutters. Consider hurricane shutters. Review insurance policies.• Be prepared to bring loose, lightweight objects inside that could become projectiles in high winds (e.g., patio furniture, garbage cans); anchor objects that would be unsafe to bring inside (e.g., propane tanks); and trim or remove trees close enough to fall on the building.• Be prepared to cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” exterior grade or marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install.Check insurance policies:Remember that homeowners insurance alone will not cover hurricane damage. You will need separate policies for hurricane as well as flood insurance to protect against damage from coastal flooding. You can buy flood insurance separately through the National Flood Insurance Program. Make sure to check and know what your existing insurance policies will or will not cover.Non-English Speakers and Disabled:If you have a family member who does not speak English or a family member who, due to a disability cannot receive emergency information readily, we highly recommend forming a core group of family or friends who can assist with translations or providing important emergency information as well as assisting with disaster preparedness actions and if needed, evacuationHurricanes and Tropical Storms:Once a storm system crosses the 140-degree west longitude mark, it enters the Central Pacific area and would be in “Hawaiian” waters.

Hurricane season began on June first and runs through November 30. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center is predicting three to six tropical cyclones and an 80-percent chance of near or above-normal tropical cyclone activity.“Due to the unpredictability of hurricanes and tropical storms all residents, visitors and businesses should take the time now to discuss hurricane preparedness and disaster preparedness plans, even though the 2018 outlook seems moderate,” said Mayor Caldwell. “Remember, it only takes one tropical storm or hurricane impacting the state to cause major problems.”Mayor Caldwell and the city’s Department of Emergency Management urge all residents to know the following:Hurricanes and Tropical Storms:Once a storm system crosses the 140-degree west longitude mark, it enters the Central Pacific area and would be in “Hawaiian” waters. The important thing to remember is that a fast storm system moving at 12 mph can reach Hawai‘i in four to five days. That is not much time to prepare. Carefully monitor any hurricanes or tropical storms that develop or enter into Hawaiian waters until they safely pass our islands or dissipate.Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu. Due to our isolation and large population nearing one million residents it could be many days before local disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14-days. Assemble basic supplies such as food, water, clothing and important medications for a 14-day kit. Also, visit our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.Evacuation Zones:Be aware that if you live on the shoreline or near the ocean you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge. Review coastal evacuation maps in your telephone white pages or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/DEM and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami/hurricane evacuation zone.Emergency Alert System (EAS):Important official emergency information such as evacuation notification and shelter locations will be broadcast over all TV and radio stations statewide using the EAS. Should your power go out during an emergency such as a hurricane, it then becomes vitally important that each household have a battery operated radio and spare batteries on hand to receive emergency information. Newer hand-crank generator or solar powered radios are also a good option. EAS broadcasts for major coastal evacuations will be aired in conjunction with a three-minute sounding of all Outdoor Siren Warning Systems on O‘ahu.Emergency and Community Information via Social Media/Online:Like and Follow the Department of Emergency Management on Twitter at @Oahu_DEM and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/OahuDEM. Additional preparedness information can also be found on our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM. Residents are also urged to follow Mayor Caldwell’s social media channels at: Twitter: @MayorKirkHNL; Facebook: facebook.com/MayorKirk; Instagram: instagram.com/mayorkirkhnl; and YouTube: youtube.com/MayorKirkHNL.Emergency Email and Text Message Alerts:O‘ahu residents are encouraged to sign-up to receive emergency email, cellphone text messages and push alerts from the City and County of Honolulu by downloading the free HNL.info app from the App Store or Google Play. You can also register online at https://hnl.info/alerts/login.php HNL.info is also perfect for vacationers and out of town family or guests. Standard text messaging rates may apply depending on your wireless carrier and plan.Non-English Speakers and Disabled:If you have a family member who does not speak English or a family member who, due to a disability cannot receive emergency information readily, we highly recommend forming a core group of family or friends who can assist with translations or providing important emergency information as well as assisting with disaster preparedness actions and if needed, evacuation.Check insurance policies:Remember that homeowners insurance alone will not cover hurricane damage. You will need separate policies for hurricane as well as flood insurance to protect against damage from coastal flooding. You can buy flood insurance separately through the National Flood Insurance Program. Make sure to check and know what your existing insurance policies will or will not cover.","Mayor urges residents to prepare for hurricane seasonHonolulu — Today at a press conference, Mayor Kirk Caldwell was joined by city officials and Meteorologist John Bravender of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center to remind O‘ahu residents and visitors that we are now in hurricane season and everyone should take the necessary precautions to prepare.

Due to our isolation and large population nearing one million residents it could be many days before local disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14-days. Assemble basic supplies such as food, water, clothing and important medications for a 14-day kit. Also, visit our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.Evacuation Zones:Be aware that if you live on the shoreline or near the ocean you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge. Review coastal evacuation maps in your telephone white pages or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/DEM and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami/hurricane evacuation zone.Emergency Alert System (EAS):Important official emergency information such as evacuation notification and shelter locations will be broadcast over all TV and radio stations statewide using the EAS. Should your power go out during an emergency such as a hurricane, it then becomes vitally important that each household have a battery operated radio and spare batteries on hand to receive emergency information. Newer hand-crank generator or solar powered radios are also a good option. EAS broadcasts for major coastal evacuations will be aired in conjunction with a three-minute sounding of all Outdoor Siren Warning Systems on O‘ahu.Emergency and Community Information via Social Media/Online:Like and Follow the Department of Emergency Management on Twitter at @Oahu_DEM and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/OahuDEM. Additional preparedness information can also be found on our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM. Residents are also urged to follow Mayor Caldwell’s social media channels at: Twitter: @MayorKirkHNL; Facebook: facebook.com/MayorKirk; Instagram: instagram.com/mayorkirkhnl; and YouTube: youtube.com/MayorKirkHNL.Emergency Email and Text Message Alerts:O‘ahu residents are encouraged to sign-up to receive emergency email, cellphone text messages and push alerts from the City and County of Honolulu by downloading the free HNL.info app from the App Store or Google Play. You can also register online at https://hnl.info/alerts/login.php HNL.info is also perfect for vacationers and out of town family or guests. Standard text messaging rates may apply depending on your wireless carrier and plan.Non-English Speakers and Disabled:If you have a family member who does not speak English or a family member who, due to a disability cannot receive emergency information readily, we highly recommend forming a core group of family or friends who can assist with translations or providing important emergency information as well as assisting with disaster preparedness actions and if needed, evacuation.Check insurance policies:Remember that homeowners insurance alone will not cover hurricane damage. You will need separate policies for hurricane as well as flood insurance to protect against damage from coastal flooding. You can buy flood insurance separately through the National Flood Insurance Program. Make sure to check and know what your existing insurance policies will or will not cover.","shared_story","link",9,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

This is meant to alert the public to the potential of severe flooding from Hurricane Lane, and the possibility of damaging winds, and will coincide with an Emergency Alert System (EAS) message (text of EAS message attached).The Attention Alert steady tone will sound for three minutes on O‘ahu only, as each county controls their own sirens. The Outdoor Siren Warning System on O‘ahu is the primary means of alerting residents who are outdoors about island-wide emergencies or evacuations.At 4 p.m. when the sirens sound, service on TheBus will be free to all patrons, including transportation to the twenty (20) evacuation shelters throughout O‘ahu. This is being done now so that anyone who wants to get to a shelter can do so safely while there is still daylight. As of noon today, seventeen (17) of the city’s twenty (20) shelters reported a total of 350 people.If you live next to a waterway or the ocean and witness rising water, don’t hesitate – evacuate and get to higher ground. Call 911 to report flooding conditions, or 768-CITY. In addition, be aware of the potential of landslides and rock falls if you live next to a cliff or ridge or valley.“We want to be sure everyone on O‘ahu is made fully aware of the threat that Hurricane Lane poses and takes it seriously,” said Mayor Caldwell. “Our Outdoor Siren Warning System is one of the best tools to bring attention to residents and visitors of the impending impacts from Hurricane Lane. Therefore, we will be issuing a siren warning at 4 p.m today. We are providing advance notice that sirens will be activated on O‘ahu to inform everyone that we remain under a hurricane warning. This is being done after the latest forecast by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center shows that Hurricane Lane continues to move slowly past the Hawaiian islands. Therefore, we are looking at a significant rain event since the storm is extremely wide and holds a lot of moisture. People need to be aware of dangerous and potentially life-threatening flooding from overflowing streams and coastal flooding from storm surge generated by Hurricane Lane.”For more information on Hurricane Lane, download the city’s smartphone app, HNL.info, which can also be viewed as a website: https://hnl.info/alerts/login.php.

This is meant to alert the public to the potential of severe flooding from Hurricane Lane, and the possibility of damaging winds, and will coincide with an Emergency Alert System (EAS) message (text of EAS message attached).The Attention Alert steady tone will sound for three minutes on O‘ahu only, as each county controls their own sirens. The Outdoor Siren Warning System on O‘ahu is the primary means of alerting residents who are outdoors about island-wide emergencies or evacuations.At 4 p.m. when the sirens sound, service on TheBus will be free to all patrons, including transportation to the twenty (20) evacuation shelters throughout O‘ahu. This is being done now so that anyone who wants to get to a shelter can do so safely while there is still daylight. As of noon today, seventeen (17) of the city’s twenty (20) shelters reported a total of 350 people.If you live next to a waterway or the ocean and witness rising water, don’t hesitate – evacuate and get to higher ground. Call 911 to report flooding conditions, or 768-CITY. In addition, be aware of the potential of landslides and rock falls if you live next to a cliff or ridge or valley.“We want to be sure everyone on O‘ahu is made fully aware of the threat that Hurricane Lane poses and takes it seriously,” said Mayor Caldwell. “Our Outdoor Siren Warning System is one of the best tools to bring attention to residents and visitors of the impending impacts from Hurricane Lane. Therefore, we will be issuing a siren warning at 4 p.m today. We are providing advance notice that sirens will be activated on O‘ahu to inform everyone that we remain under a hurricane warning. This is being done after the latest forecast by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center shows that Hurricane Lane continues to move slowly past the Hawaiian islands. Therefore, we are looking at a significant rain event since the storm is extremely wide and holds a lot of moisture. People need to be aware of dangerous and potentially life-threatening flooding from overflowing streams and coastal flooding from storm surge generated by Hurricane Lane.”For more information on Hurricane Lane, download the city’s smartphone app, HNL.info, which can also be viewed as a website: https://hnl.info/alerts/login.php.

Lane is moving toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue through Friday. A turn toward the west is anticipated Saturday, with an increase in forward speed. On the latest forecast track, the center of Lane will move over, or dangerously close to portions of the main Hawaiian islands late Friday and Friday night.Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher gusts. Lane remains a powerful category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some weakening is forecast from Friday through late Saturday, but Lane is expected to remain a hurricane as it approaches the islands.Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles(205 km).The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------WIND: Tropical storm conditions are already occurring on the Big Island, Maui County and Oahu. These conditions will likely persist through early Friday morning. Hurricane conditions are expected over some areas of Maui County and Oahu starting Friday and continuing through Friday night. Tropical storm or hurricane conditions are possible on Kauai starting late Friday or Friday night.RAINFALL: Rain bands will continue to overspread the Hawaiian Islands well ahead of Lane. Excessive rainfall associated with this slow moving hurricane will continue to impact the Hawaiian Islands into the weekend, leading to significant and life-threatening flash flooding and landslides. Lane is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 10 to 20 inches, with localized amounts of 30 to 40 inches possible over portions of the Hawaiian Islands. Over two feet of rain has already fallen at a few locations on the windward side of the Big Island.SURF: Very large swells generated by the slow moving hurricane will severely impact the Hawaiian Islands over the next couple of days.These swells will produce extremely large and damaging surf along exposed west and south facing shorelines. A prolonged period of high surf will likely lead to significant coastal erosion.STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and large breaking waves will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along south and west facing shores near the center of Lane.

Lane is movingtoward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this general motion isexpected to continue through tonight. A turn toward the west isanticipated on Saturday, with an increase in forward speed. Thecenter of Lane will remain dangerously close to portions of thecentral Hawaiian islands later today and tonight.Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with highergusts. Weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from thecenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles(220 km).The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------WIND: Tropical storm conditions are already occurring on the BigIsland, Maui County and Oahu. Hurricane conditions are expected overportions of of Maui County and Oahu starting tonight. Tropical stormconditions are possible on Kauai starting Saturday.RAINFALL: Rain bands from Lane will continue to affect the mainHawaiian Islands with excessive rainfall possible into the weekend.These rains could lead to additional major flash flooding andlandslides. Lane is expected to produce total rain accumulations of10 to 20 inches in some areas. Localized storm total amounts up to40 inches are possible, mainly on the windward side of the BigIsland where over 30 inches of rain has already fallen in someareas.SURF: Very large swells generated by the slow moving hurricane willseverely impact the Hawaiian Islands into this weekend. These swellswill produce life-threatening and damaging surf along exposedshorelines, particularly today through Saturday. In addition, aprolonged period of extreme surf will also likely lead tosignificant coastal erosion.STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and largebreaking waves will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feetabove normal tide levels along south and west facing shores nearthe center of Lane. The surge will be accompanied by large anddestructive waves.NEXT ADVISORY-------------Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM HST.Next complete advisory at 500 PM HST.Mayor Caldwell and the city’s Department of Emergency Management urges all residents to know the following:Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu. Due to our isolation and large population nearing one million residents it could be many days before local disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14-days. Assemble basic supplies such as food, water, clothing and important medications for a 14-day kit. Also, visit our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.Evacuation Zones:Be aware that if you live on the shoreline or near the ocean you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge. Review coastal evacuation maps in your telephone white pages or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/DEM and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami/hurricane evacuation zone.Emergency Alert System (EAS): Important official emergency information such as evacuation notification and shelter locations will be broadcast over all TV and radio stations statewide using the EAS. Should your power go out during an emergency such as a hurricane, it then becomes vitally important that each household have a battery operated radio and spare batteries on hand to receive emergency information. Newer hand-crank generator or solar powered radios are also a good option. EAS broadcasts for major coastal evacuations will be aired in conjunction with a three-minute sounding of all Outdoor Siren Warning Systems on O‘ahu.Emergency and Community Information via Social Media/Online:Like and Follow the Department of Emergency Management on Twitter at @Oahu_DEM and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/OahuDEM. Additional preparedness information can also be found on our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM. Residents are also urged to follow Mayor Caldwell’s social media channels at: Twitter: @MayorKirkHNL; Facebook: facebook.com/MayorKirk; Instagram: instagram.com/mayorkirkhnl; and YouTube: youtube.com/MayorKirkHNL.Emergency Email and Text Message Alerts:O‘ahu residents are encouraged to sign-up to receive emergency email, cellphone text messages and push alerts from the City and County of Honolulu by downloading the free HNL.info app from the App Store or Google Play. You can also register online at https://hnl.info/alerts/login.php HNL.info is also perfect for vacationers and out of town family or guests. Standard text messaging rates may apply depending on your wireless carrier and plan.Preparing your home:• Protect your property. Declutter drains and gutters. Consider hurricane shutters. Review insurance policies.• Be prepared to bring loose, lightweight objects inside that could become projectiles in high winds (e.g., patio furniture, garbage cans); anchor objects that would be unsafe to bring inside (e.g., propane tanks); and trim or remove trees close enough to fall on the building.• Be prepared to cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” exterior grade or marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install.Check insurance policies:Remember that homeowners insurance alone will not cover hurricane damage. You will need separate policies for hurricane as well as flood insurance to protect against damage from coastal flooding. You can buy flood insurance separately through the National Flood Insurance Program.

Lane is movingtoward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this general motion isexpected to continue through tonight. A turn toward the west isanticipated on Saturday, with an increase in forward speed. Thecenter of Lane will remain dangerously close to portions of thecentral Hawaiian islands later today and tonight.Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with highergusts. Weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from thecenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles(220 km).The estimated minimum central pressure is 966 mb (28.53 inches).HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------WIND: Tropical storm conditions are already occurring on the BigIsland, Maui County and Oahu. Hurricane conditions are expected overportions of of Maui County and Oahu starting tonight. Tropical stormconditions are possible on Kauai starting Saturday.RAINFALL: Rain bands from Lane will continue to affect the mainHawaiian Islands with excessive rainfall possible into the weekend.These rains could lead to additional major flash flooding andlandslides. Lane is expected to produce total rain accumulations of10 to 20 inches in some areas. Localized storm total amounts up to40 inches are possible, mainly on the windward side of the BigIsland where over 30 inches of rain has already fallen in someareas.SURF: Very large swells generated by the slow moving hurricane willseverely impact the Hawaiian Islands into this weekend. These swellswill produce life-threatening and damaging surf along exposedshorelines, particularly today through Saturday. In addition, aprolonged period of extreme surf will also likely lead tosignificant coastal erosion.STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and largebreaking waves will raise water levels by as much as 2 to 4 feetabove normal tide levels along south and west facing shores nearthe center of Lane. The surge will be accompanied by large anddestructive waves.NEXT ADVISORY-------------Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM HST.Next complete advisory at 500 PM HST.Mayor Caldwell and the city’s Department of Emergency Management urges all residents to know the following:Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu. Due to our isolation and large population nearing one million residents it could be many days before local disaster relief efforts reach all of those who are affected.Individuals, families and businesses should be prepared to be on their own for at least 14-days. Assemble basic supplies such as food, water, clothing and important medications for a 14-day kit. Also, visit our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM for more disaster preparedness information and to access downloadable information sheets.Evacuation Zones:Be aware that if you live on the shoreline or near the ocean you may have to evacuate due to the hazard of hurricane produced storm surge. Review coastal evacuation maps in your telephone white pages or visit our web site at www.honolulu.gov/DEM and follow the instructions on the Tsunami Map Viewer to quickly see if you are in a tsunami/hurricane evacuation zone.Emergency Alert System (EAS): Important official emergency information such as evacuation notification and shelter locations will be broadcast over all TV and radio stations statewide using the EAS. Should your power go out during an emergency such as a hurricane, it then becomes vitally important that each household have a battery operated radio and spare batteries on hand to receive emergency information. Newer hand-crank generator or solar powered radios are also a good option. EAS broadcasts for major coastal evacuations will be aired in conjunction with a three-minute sounding of all Outdoor Siren Warning Systems on O‘ahu.Emergency and Community Information via Social Media/Online:Like and Follow the Department of Emergency Management on Twitter at @Oahu_DEM and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/OahuDEM. Additional preparedness information can also be found on our website at www.honolulu.gov/DEM. Residents are also urged to follow Mayor Caldwell’s social media channels at: Twitter: @MayorKirkHNL; Facebook: facebook.com/MayorKirk; Instagram: instagram.com/mayorkirkhnl; and YouTube: youtube.com/MayorKirkHNL.Emergency Email and Text Message Alerts:O‘ahu residents are encouraged to sign-up to receive emergency email, cellphone text messages and push alerts from the City and County of Honolulu by downloading the free HNL.info app from the App Store or Google Play. You can also register online at https://hnl.info/alerts/login.php HNL.info is also perfect for vacationers and out of town family or guests. Standard text messaging rates may apply depending on your wireless carrier and plan.Preparing your home:• Protect your property. Declutter drains and gutters. Consider hurricane shutters. Review insurance policies.• Be prepared to bring loose, lightweight objects inside that could become projectiles in high winds (e.g., patio furniture, garbage cans); anchor objects that would be unsafe to bring inside (e.g., propane tanks); and trim or remove trees close enough to fall on the building.• Be prepared to cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” exterior grade or marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install.Check insurance policies:Remember that homeowners insurance alone will not cover hurricane damage. You will need separate policies for hurricane as well as flood insurance to protect against damage from coastal flooding. You can buy flood insurance separately through the National Flood Insurance Program. Make sure to check and know what your existing insurance policies will or will not cover.Non-English Speakers and Disabled:If you have a family member who does not speak English or a family member who, due to a disability cannot receive emergency information readily, we highly recommend forming a core group of family or friends who can assist with translations or providing important emergency information as well as assisting with disaster preparedness actions and if needed, evacuationHurricanes and Tropical Storms:Once a storm system crosses the 140-degree west longitude mark, it enters the Central Pacific area and would be in “Hawaiian” waters.

For everyone who went through the days leading up to hurricane Lane, take the lessons we learned and use them now.With our planet experiencing the effects of climate change, we are going to have to treat these kinds of repeated events as a new reality, and not only prepare accordingly, but also tackle the emissions creating this problem.I want to stress the importance of preparing adequately, but again, I’m asking that people not purchase more than they need, and if you have purchased more than needed, please don’t return items; rather keep supplies on hand for the remainder for hurricane season.”There is an increasing threat for tropical storm force winds to O‘ahu as Hurricane Olivia remains a category 1 hurricane, moving 16 miles per hour, 750 miles east of Hilo. Olivia is still forecast to be a tropical storm as it approaches the state. Stronger wind shear will lead to a gradual weakening, but there is still a possibility of tropical storm force winds as it approaches the islands. The overall track has been shifting southward with time, but any part of the state still could feel a direct impact.

During this morning’s teleconference, the National weather service has advised on the possibility of tropical storm force winds to borderline hurricane force winds affecting the islands. With O‘ahu now under a tropical storm watch, there is potential not just for major flooding, but also damaging winds.“We have all seen first-hand the kind of damage a tropical storm can bring. We only experienced the remnants of tropical storm Darby on O‘ahu in 2016, and its effects were significant.” said Mayor Kirk Caldwell. “After this morning’s update, it looks like we feel direct impacts from this storm on O‘ahu, and we should all prepare accordingly.I want to stress the importance of preparing adequately, but again, by now, we should all have our hurricane kits ready, along with our 14 day supply of food and water. These are items we should all keep on hand for the remainder for hurricane season.”There is an increasing threat for tropical storm force winds to O‘ahu as Hurricane Olivia is forecast to be a strong tropical storm or borderline hurricane as it approaches the state. The relative uncertainty in its track forecast also means it could directly impact any island. Currently there is little or no wind shear near Olivia although the shear does increase as it approaches the state. As of this morning the storm is moving 8 at miles per hour, and is less than 500 miles East-Northeast of Hilo.Another briefing on Hurricane Olivia will be held at the city’s EOC at 5:30 p.m. today, Monday, September 10th.In preparation for the storm the City’s Department of Facility Maintenance has been clearing stream beds and mouths since last week, and continues to do so.Residents and visitors can track Hurricane Olivia directly by visiting the Central Pacific Hurricane Center website at: http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/Disaster Preparedness:Take the time now to consider basic disaster preparedness and what actions you or your family will take in the event a hurricane threatens O‘ahu.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK----------------------At 1100 PM HST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Olivia was located by aircraft near latitude 22.0 North, longitude 150.1 West. Olivia is moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn to the west and west-southwest is expected early Tuesday, with this general motion continuing for the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Olivia will be moving over the main Hawaiian Islands late Tuesday night into Wednesday.Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but Olivia is expected to remain a tropical storm as it moves over the islands. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km) from the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND----------------------WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected over Maui County and the Big Island starting late Tuesday or Tuesday night. Tropical storm conditions are expected over Oahu starting late Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.
