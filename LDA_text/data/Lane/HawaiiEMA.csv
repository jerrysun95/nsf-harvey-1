During this monthly test, all warning sirens will sound a one-minute Attention Alert Signal (Steady Tone). There will be no exercise or drill accompanying the test.The Attention Alert Signal informs residents to turn on a radio or television for information and instruction for an impending emergency, or if in a coastal inundation area, evacuate to higher ground.

These areas include portions of Kalaeloa, Makakilo, Nanakuli, Kapolei, & Ewa Beach.

During this monthly test, all warning sirens will sound a one-minute Attention Alert Signal (Steady Tone). There will be no exercise or drill accompanying the test.The Attention Alert Signal informs residents to turn on a radio or television for information and instruction for an impending emergency, or if in a coastal inundation area, evacuate to higher ground. Oahu residents in areas surrounding Campbell Industrial Park may also hear a ‚Äúwhooping‚Äù tone following the siren test. These areas include portions of Kalaeloa, Makakilo, Nanakuli, Kapolei, & Ewa Beach. The ‚Äúwhooping‚Äù tone is a test of the Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) siren warning group that will be activated in the event of a HAZMAT incident requiring emergency notification of businesses, schools and residents within the vicinity of Campbell Industrial Park. Contact the City and County of Honolulu Department of Emergency Management at (808) 723-8960 for more information on the HAZMAT warning group siren test.The outdoor warning sirens are one part of a three-component emergency notification system. A simultaneous test of the Emergency Alert System is conducted with the siren system, in cooperation with Hawaii‚Äôs broadcast industry. In the event of a real emergency, warning sirens and Emergency Alert Broadcasts would be joined by alerts via the Wireless Emergency Alert system, which delivers sound-and-text warnings to mobile telephones and compatible devices.Emergency management and disaster preparedness information is located at the front section of telephone directories in all counties.
