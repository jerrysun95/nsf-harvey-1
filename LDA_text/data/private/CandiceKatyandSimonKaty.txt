Candice Katy and Simon KatyQ:I want you to resay that because I had not thought about the fact that when they couldnt get information from an official source they went through friends who were officialsYesYeahM:Or friends of a friendQ:Using social mediaM:I mean because the other thing why too right was close enough Maybe they didnt even know Candice directly but they knew  YesExactlyI was coordinating rescues with the officials using social media because I had the right connections at the right moment and I was trapped So I was a captive audience to these peopleM:And my wife would tell me about some of your posts So do you remember meYes yes yes Good to see you I was like I know that personM:We used to be in the same Sunday school class at _[0:43] So Laura followed her husbands  her dads run for mayor During the floods Candice just posted this I was like Okay Ive heard the same thingQ:And its the Katy mayor  you said the Katy mayorM:Yes Katy mayorAnd theyre all over Brian to become a PIO They ask him constantly One day because of thisM:And that is a challenge Harris County sheriffs are somewhat notorious for not communicating quite as well as they could I really wish-Q:Well theyre huge arent theyM:I would love to know who are their officials so that I could  or even if theyre unofficial Because the constables  Precinct 5-Two officials ones But they sit downtown behind __[1:26]M:Yeah they dont _Which is why they want him They want someone on the groundM:Weve seen five constables just named in the brand-new PIO I havent met him yet We meet him next week But he apparently is more from this side of town and knows a little betterSo Brian probably knows himM:So yeah it was friends of a friend And we actually saw the same thing because we would go to OEM and wed call the fire desk and we would ask for National Guard Resources And they would say Great Were sending it The problem is that might take 2 3 4 hours So instead of waiting those 4 hours after about an hour or two we just started calling the sheriffs the constables and saying Hey do you have anything Oh yeah weve got two national guard guys right here Well send them over And so by the time the fire desk got their people here sometimes we didnt even need them anymore So it wasnt even just social media We were finding ways  the national guards The national guard trucks would not go into any of the flood waters without armed escorts They cannot be armed themselves when theyre functioning in civilian capacities like this so they couldnt have any weapons But because they were not armed they had to have armed protectionAnd the armed protection worked as guides The national guardsmen dont know where to goM:So we had one situation at our __ [2:50] site in Kingswood  it was a mobile command post where we had National Guard trucks sitting there ready to go in But we needed 12 law enforcement officers and no single entity  the sheriffs would give us 4 or 5 DPS would give us 4 or 5 but we couldnt get 12 from any one agency So the trucks wouldnt go unless all of them had their escorts So we had citizens lining the street in __[3:14] watching us and theyre going Why four hours later are you guys not going in there You can see people waving Why wont you go help them And were sitting here But the fire desks  do you know what theyre doing A couple of our volunteers are neighbors of Constable Ted They called Ted on cell phone and said Ted we need some law enforcement guys He sent some guys over and we got in the water But it was because we had Constable Teds personal cell phone And then as it went on we just started  through fire desk  were just going to call Constable And whoever we needed we would call them directly and circumvent the system Which is probably not great for public consumption but I share that with you because it did happen It happened across the board And it really became people you know If you had a way to get information to the right person you got action Like I said getting the reunification signals cleared was because a Congressman calls office Had we not made those calls and they said You know what This is done Were just ignoring that law Get it done Then we wouldnt have had any place to move people for clear for days And thats the frustrating thingQ:Interesting Its so interesting because it becomes  rules and operating procedures are set up to work and theyre set up to work more efficiently But time and time again in almost all my research  so I published some research on active fear campus emergencies And I did focus groups at UT right after ours happened The most petrifying thing I heard students say is that Why would I trust the police If my friend was standing there and said he saw somebody with a gun Im sure going to believe my friend over some police officer They dont even know where they are And Im sitting here going This is about 2008 when people were saying this And I kept saying to everybody Theres a difference here People do not just automatically trust official sources And some of it has to do with the timeliness Some of it has to do with the instant informationM:And being forced to give vague statements I honestly I had some  the only issue that I had with what we were putting out on our page was they wanted more updates they wanted more often I refused to post something I could not  I was not going to say  I was not going to be vague And so I made sure I had actual information before I posted But people do They want it instantly And if they aren't gonna get it from you you're gonna get it from somebody else And unfortunately that's the balance of putting out good information I think unfortunately the media knows that so they just put out information They don't really care about the validity so much anymore Civilians here in the media putting out information and accept it as official information that's not  M:And they never hear the corrections One thing that's really interesting  for the City of Katy that might be a nice little piece of research is: 20 years ago Katy was the country The mayor's office didn't have a computer M:Yeah everything was done in [6:34] Yeah Using social media to respond in crisis is like revolutionary to people in government in the city They know they need it but they have no idea how because they're just not there yet Katy became a major metropolitan area overnight but the infrastructure that was set up to respond  and their use of social media honestly was just non-existent It was fortuitous that the new mayor was the chief of police before he became mayor and was elected months before the incident happened so he knew one phone call how to get the National Guard across the street from the city Q:Wow And so those  person connections is definitely huge but it was a bit of a vacuum in the city because of this issue of how big it grew and how low on resources they have [sic] They have now hired a social media person in response to these needs M:Really I hadn't heard that In addition Maria has been functioning as that  Maria [Galvez]  the OEM has been doing a little bit of that Is this now for the City of Katy The City of Katy M:Really I would love to get to meet that person I'm not super cued in I've had email exchanges I can work on it yeah M:Chuck knows Chief [Evie] very well They're in good communication One of the things that we were just talking about over here with some of the other ladies is: Most of the agencies in Katy  like I said ten different fire departments nine different law enforcement agencies and about three or four different EMS  [crosstalk] at least five or six Yeah Q:Just in Katy M:Yeah Because Katy PD  well unfortunately  and I don't know if Chuck did this  They just updated M:And they brought fire in Katy Fire used to be like the redheaded stepchild of the whole city Katy PD has now incorporated them into  and even Katy PD's dispatch has reached out to us because they never had bothered to map the other responding agencies Even though they are a neighboring department when we get mutual aid they would come in and then they would get on their phones to find us So now the [CAD] systems are actually programming their surrounding mutual aid partners programming it in so they can see what we see But that's part of the issue We have different dispatch systems different radio systems Katy Fire and Police have 800s so they can communicate with us but some of our local [PSDs] don't They have the old 400 radios and they don't talk to 800 radios So there's a lot of that kind of stuff [crosstalk]   transcends those kind of [9:25] differences or language differences and that's one reason that made it so effective M:Well and Mayor Brawner's office was unfortunately  compared to what happened with Tax Day floods it was night and day the response within Katy and surrounding That's the interesting thing too The previous mayor really it was Katy proper or nothing Q:Oh yes I've seen that M:It was very focused So Chuck obviously has to take care of his constituents but he was also very interested and became part of communicating with the National Guard and stuff Once Katy was kind of done he kind of directed them to who else to reach out to It was the first time that it felt in the non-Katy-proper area that the mayor was working for the betterment of all of Katy Whereas in the past it was Katy proper and everyone else you're on your own So that I think was a big positive change To finish what I was saying I would love to have a PIO or social media group that when we have a major incident that affects all the Katy area that we have contacts that I can call this gal over there I would call Maria Galvez with OEM but Katy OEM is so still Katy-proper focused Westlake doesn't have that which is the fire department over by Frye Road Willow Fork doesn't There are certain ones who do and certain ones who don't I would love to over the next few years have a group that we can call and say "All right here's what we have This is the most official information Let's all put this out all at the same time and with a similar voice" That way if everyone sees that every major fire department and law enforcement are putting the same information out they'll know it's true Q:Oh that's an interesting  that's really interesting M:Versus I put something out and then the Fort Bend guys put something out that's somewhat dissimilar Now who's right Not necessarily a contradiction but a different voice M:And maybe it's because they're in a different space If they're dealing with river flooding and I'm dealing with  [11:32] flooding it's completely different flooding So my language might be different and who and what steps they might want to take especially if it's a different county I may be asking 'em to reach out to different resources or call different phone numbers than they are But if we all come together and say "Hey here's what we about to post Do you guys have any issues with this Great Let's all put it out We'll post it around noon" Then everyone's doing the same thing and we get a common voice even if it's not the same message a common voice out and people feel they can trust us again That's been part of the issue is trust And being more instant I think that is how quickly in a dynamic situation if you cant give the update every hour its not enoughQ:No its notIt becomes white noise Q:Thats exactly right M:That was my question because I could have had four or five more volunteers sitting there at computers helping us update We could have done so much better But I was so busy answering things I couldnt get new data I wasnt ever gonna get to an hour but I would have loved to give every four hours It turned out to be more like once a day but when I posted it was accurate it was up-to-date it was  [12:47] Then you could sit there and respond So that to me is what you need Technically we call it our emergency operations center but in a grander  [13:00] we would be a district operations center in a district Q:Oh interestingM:But the problem was we were the only one with a DOC set up Katy had their own Harris County eventually got there but Brian was demandingM:Yes but it was after the fact Q:You said your husband is BrianBrian Brawner Hes Harris Countys Sheriffs Office Hes a sergeant with Harris County Sheriffs Office out here in the district that responded but hes the only one with emergency response training at this levelM:Its very important around here which is what [Cal] was saying Fire marshals when they did their first debriefing of all the fire departments they did it at our office The main reason they did it they said you are the only ones that issued IAPs every day IAP is incident action plan Every day every 12 hours were supposed to we hit every 12 most of the time but at least every day we had an IAP that we sent to Harris County Fire Marshal Thats what emergency management training told you to do Not a single other fire department did that Its actually what fired for some FEMA fund reimbursement so the City of Houston is literally having to go back and make themQ:Oh noM:Because they didnt do any IAPs for the whole week But thats if NIMS was followed properly like Brian said and each agency had their own structure then everything would fit together perfectly Thats how its designed You have a bunch of different  [14:36] It was really difficult because we would go to Wilfork who serves this area and say Hey Wilfork whats your IAP IA whatWhat is thatQ:Oh noBut you had civilians who knew itM:Yes You had civilians at command posts who were going heres our plan This is what were gonna do These are the dangers and all that kind of stuffQ:Thats so interestingAn interesting recommendation I really liked what you said that connects into your research is the idea of having volunteers on hand to support the IO because that isM:It takes peopleIt does It takes peopleM:You cant watch five screens at onceYou could vet and train them just like you have volunteer police officersM:And [Sherry Rath] is our social media liaison so shes been working with this for over a year Thats why I asked Chief I was like hey can I call her in He said absolutely So she came in she was sitting in the EOC with us the entire time until she went home I would have loved to have had four more of her And I could over the next In fact were probably gonna post later in January for additional volunteers in certain categories We also want some specifically with drone training Theres a handful and were just gonna say hey come on the team Get involved Do other things Get involved with the CPR program or smoke alarms all the other things we do But then when we need you we have a list of 10-15Right [Seals] inventory kind of thingM:Exactly We need these three people Can you guys come up and be able to do that kind of thingQ:WowM:If every agency did that its hard because Katy Fire they got rid of all their volunteers and all their part-timers Theyre all 100% full-time now so they dont have anyone to draw from to do that kind of thing unfortunately  [16:16] setbackQ:What would be the best way for me to get in touch with himI can just give you his cell phone numberQ:OkayIts 281-732-3918 He has some similar certainly comments and thoughts on how social media was used what was effective about it what was not effective when it came to law enforcement personally using it Then how they communicated between then and National Guard; that was really interestingQ:I would love to know more about itHow they ended up using social media instead of cell phones They use WhatsAppQ:They do use WhatsAppThe SWAT team uses WhatsApp which the real word is not SWAT Thats the name people use Because of the way that you can set different notifications on it and it can come through even when its not text messaging Anyway so they use it so that would be interesting to get some of that to connect to your research for sure M:One of the reasons we found  we didnt realize this until later  weve actually purchased some for this reason National Guard comes out they dont come out with radios They didnt have radios so theres no way for them to communicateQ:WhatM: So theyre brought to a command post theyre given an assignment they go do that assignment and they come back Theres no way for them to talk to civiliansQ:WhatM:So we actually are buying a bulk of basically reserve radios that we will use in the future to issue to National Guard if they come to town againQ:Heres one question Did they use their personal cell phonesM:Yes they didYes they did M:And some of them lost themQ:They didM:YesSome of them got in trouble for using their personal cell phonesM:And if they lost them they werent reimbursed because those were personal items It was crazyBrian lost his phone and it was  [17:58] He said it could have cost lives [crosstalk]Q:Exactly rightM:Yeah And then we had bootsHe didnt physically he lost it as in it got water damaged So eventually all the cops put their phones in  [18:11] bags M:National Guard really I felt bad for them Their boots were ruined when they had floodwater You cannot rehab rubber leather boots We ended up buying them new pairs and giving them some Then we just ate it But then also tetanus shots They  My husbands  [18:29] did a little research Did a little fundraiser and we bought 100 pairs of bootsM:I saw that Q:Thats great M:But no they had no tetanus shots To get tetanus shots there was all this paperwork and this  [18:45] and all this kind of stuff So our EMS chief just said hey guys come here Dont say anything And we took care of every National Guard guy that came to our area gave then a tetanus shot because the waters they were in they just needed itQ:They absolutely needed itM:But the protocol and paperwork for them to get that done through their normal channels it would have been weeks Their primary focus isnt necessarily active disasters Their primary focus is just after Q:Really recovery Immediate recoveryQ:Thats rightSo Brian said I was watching them set up cots You dont need cots! People are dying Theres no cots lets go!M:Yeah well do that laterQ:Wow Now is Harris County thats Houston rightYeah most of Houston is in Harris County Q:Is that Art Acevedo Is that the same police You said sheriff M:NoNoQ:Harris County sheriff is separate from the City of HoustonHes City of HoustonM:HPD The HPD is Houston Police Department So Harris County and City of Houston overlap Harris County is the responders just more here Anyone who is being rescued on the northern side of Katy West Houston and the northern sideM:Remember I was talking about the number of law enforcement agencies Depending on where you are in Katy it could be HPD Harris County Constable Precinct 5 In the Katy area it could be Harris County Sheriffs It could be Katy ISD policeIt could be the City of Katy police M:And it could be the City of Katy policeIt could be Waller Police It could be They aint coming but it could beM:And then on Fort Bend you have Fort Bend County Sheriffs Office and you have Fort Bend Precinct 3 Constables Then you also have DPS if its on the highwayI was gonna say theres more municipalitiesM:Then theres one other Those are the main ones There are some little onesM:But thats what you have to deal with It depends on where you are which one gets  [20:37] jurisdiction There were troopers sitting at home watching TV Their command structure said no youre not Youre goodQ:As somebody who lives here how do I know who to callM:Well so the [engine roll] you call 911 The dispatch M: The problem was Harris County 911 was inundated They werent ready for it A lot of people  and this isnt for publication  Q:Okay Ill make sure Dont record this section M:They flooded and lost thousands of calls Q:The building floodedM:The building floodedHarris Countys flooded the substation flooded So the police officers had no home base They set up at Home Depot Q:And they couldnt reroute the calls to anotherM:Some of them were lost So they were put in [compute] queues and when the computers were down they went to backups but anything that was in there was lost When people said literally they called and no one ever came that actually did happen Q:Yeah because Ive heard that a lotM:Fortunately we use a separate com center So Harris County 911 receives the call determines who and where and then transfers that to the com center We use Cy-Fair PD  [21:48] com center Q:Okay so this is okay to record M:That was fine yeah Just dont share that Harris County 911 went dark Thats the part thats not  [21:58] But Harris County 911 then forwards it So the problem is Harris County 911 also receives calls for Fort Bend So Harris County 911 receives pretty much all the 911s within the region Then they send it to Katy PD or com center for us or Cy-Fair has their own and they decide which it gets sent to The problem is the bottleneck is Harris County 911 They need an upgrade They need more personnel The biggest thing is scalability Even though theyre 30 miles away their people flooded too M:Yes So they couldnt get more people inTheyre running law and  [22:36] tooQ:Thats right M:I feel bad for some of those people literally being on the phone over and over and then people getting outraged because this is the third and fourth time So yeah Theres definitely some infrastructure there that could be improved So that became the issue was people started calling non-emergency numbers People were calling old non-emergency numbers like our old number is now  what used to be our general non-emergency got changed when we had our new admin building but that one still rings just in case rings to Station 3 So Station 3 was getting called because they couldnt get 911 so they figured well lets call the non-emergency number So the corps battalion chief with Station 3 he was answering the phone every four to five minutes Because the number is only left there so that it goes to somewhere there is no voicemail rollover Q:Oh no!M:So people were getting busy signals at our old non-emergency number Now if they had gone onto our  [23:38] they would have found a new one But some people saved it years ago its been the same for forever so they just have it in their phone So like I said when people cant get an official they will find different channels If its not in  [23:50] they will choose something that they know I personally coordinated rescues from my living room on my laptop using the state troopers who werent being given assignments because the actual law enforcement people who could respond were already out and being used So there was an older couple who again five years ago this wouldnt have happened because they werent on Facebook they were probably theyre around my parents age so late 60s early 70s They used Facebook to say we need help I used Google Maps to look because I know where their house is but I didnt physically remember their address I got on Google Maps found their address and used Facebook to message our friend thats a trooper his wife to say where is Matt He has got to go help these people They are six houses away but they are under water even though she was  [24:51] It took three hours but they finally got over there and got them and then they had to do a [leg] I mean that was actually on the first night when it was flooding because the City of Katy police were told to shut their place because it wasnt safe for them They couldnt help anybody They would have just been swept away In fact a National Guardsman did get swept away and they eventually found him That was outside my houseM:That was the only fatality in Katy Q:Was it reallyIt was like 100 yards from my house Anyway they finally rescued them but they had been outside and without power for so long that they rescued them and they got them away but it was all orchestrated on Facebook and text messagesM:I put a note on [25:42] for you to remind me to get you in touch with Matt Fuhrman Matt is a member of my CrossFit gym but hes a corporate recruiter So hes always  [25:54] Hes a big networker They had a faculty meeting well hes a [family guy] so he was already in Georgia on some assignment for a client and so he told his wife Michelle he was like hey go ahead Our house is probably gonna be fine but go ahead and grab the kids and just come hang out with me You can stay in the hotel So he did that Well then all this stuff starts happening So people are asking all that kind of stuff So he ends up setting up multiple computers and doing exactly what  [26:23] was doing and just coordinating He had a whole bunch of guys within our CrossFit gym who had a big uplifted trucks so they were getting everyone with big high-lift trucks and with boats Then since he knew I was with the fire department he would ask me Hey whats this area Whats that It became such a big deal he ended up I forget how many hundreds of rescues he helped facilitate local media in Georgia did a story on him and came to look at Matts command post They went into his hotel room and he showed them how he had Zillow on one screen and he had this on that screen He was just going through  not Zillow butZelloM:Yeah the dispatching thing So he had all these screens He literally was and I would get texts from him in the middle of the day going Hey we have a confirmed person None of my boats can get there Hes in your territory So he was helping to dispatch us to people He was doing all that from Georgia because he had went there and his wife evacuated to him and he was a very well-connected guy in the Katy area It was wild to see some of that stuff and I felt bad because so many times when he would bring me something I would be like Matt Im trying I cant get over there Its gonna be a while Oftentimes the beauty of it was because he knew he would come back and say Hey we already got them Awesome cool But we would still put it up on our board Q:SureM:And that was I think something that this is what Im curious from our departments standpoint the next time something like this happens we want to have a better idea of best practices Q:Thats what Im curious about tooM:And so I would love to get this feedback especially  What are best practices when it comes to  [28:10]M:Like I said  Theres nothing It doesnt existQ:No it doesntM:I dont know if you were here Candice but we brought this up earlier in the morning And that was how do you when you have a list from dispatch that you know is vetted and you have a list from civilian social media how do you send your guys over here when you know you have somebody over here You cant really do that Then this person says its an emergency but its an emergency because their ankles are wet Versus this person has a surgery One lady had a surgery and even though shes mobile she cant get in the water or risk sepsis Q:And thats the challenge is that people define emergencies so differently What an individual thinks is an emergency is different The other thing that worries me actually the most is that its become very clear to me in a very limited period of time that if you say you have a medical emergency you go to the top of the list So everybody knows that now So next time oh you bet Im having a heart attack M:You wouldnt believe how many kids My kid has asthma Q:That is some of what bothers me and has me worried is that once people learn the tricks and how to circumvent its gonna create even a harder situation Part of me is wondering Ive heard it from a lot of neighborhoods especially along Memorial every home for half a mile was completely flooded and everyone needed to be evacuated So in those settings you sent your boats in and anyone and everyone they could get they got on their way But then you have these neighborhoods where it was two people here and six people here Thats a very different kind of you dont send And then the complicationsM:You dont have the densityQ:You dont have the density And then the other thing thats interesting that I started to kind of picture is it depends on what kind of boat you have It doesQ:You cant just send in a boat with an outboard and  And the boat that was the right one on the first day wasnt the right boat on the second or the third dayM:Because of clearances and everything else and currents We had a boat captain and I bet you he might be interested Hed probably be able to help you as well The one boat captain the first day they got here they were trying to get to us because we had told them that wed be happy to work with us Hes a former volunteer firefighter so he kind of knows a little bit  [30:40] command He was coming down 10 and he ends up getting stopped at Dairy Ashford where theres this apartment They were going in and helping evacuate people from the apartment He said that the HFD guys didnt have eight or nine boats in all of HFD They ended up capsizing one thereIm surprised they have eight or nine M:YeahI mean Im surprised they have that manyM:For all of Houston eight or nine boatsWhich you might not use for 30 years M:Yeah thats true Although they did just two years ago Yeah Q:WowM:So we now have eight ourselves so we have as many as HFD So they ended up capsizing a boat He put his guys in They were fortunately able all the firefighters were able to get out because it was still waist level They were able to get out and they were able to walk through the current and they just ditched the boat They got back on the truck and they left So this guy was like I cant believe there are still people screaming Were gonna go in and help Well because they had jet boats with low clearance and they knew how to handle current because they are river boat captains  Q:Yes that makes senseM:They were able to get in there and they got another 100 or so people So they didnt even make it to us until like midnight that night because HFD was not equipped to be able to handle the current coming under the overpass where they were putting inQ:Oh yeah! That makes complete senseM:And so even if they had boats you would not think We had that issueQ:Theyre not trained Theyre not trained boatersM:YeahQ:Thats not what you do as your jobM:Even if you do practice water rescues youre not gonna practice current-based water rescues because what does Houston have that would involve that And if they do they have that one water teamWhich is crazy that [Colin] was out here that he randomly had this major piece of knowledge and experience that related to something How could you possibly think that would be impactful here And that he was willing to do it And here not traveling internationally Divine interventionM:Oh absolutelyI just heard from [Theresa] Her name is Parisa and her last name is Reith She runs social media for Harris County Sheriffs Office Q:Oh wonderfulShe is the social media person for Harris County Sheriffs Office And this is her phone number and she gave me permission to give it to you so you can contact her Q: [33:11] going to talk to me tooSeriously For Harris County There should be a social media debrief next time That should happenM:Absolutely Q:Actually there should I don't know if this would be helpful but there has been a little bit written specifically on PIOs and social media And I know that literature because we cited it to write this proposal Dont know if that would be helpful but I can at least share M:I would love that Absolutely Q:Its gonna be academic-y butM:The other thing I could do I could put you in touch with the Harris County Office of Emergency Management Francisco Sanchez is their PIO for OEM Hes specifically OEM so most of what they should have is more general than broad unfortunately but he has formed the Harris County PIO Network The problem is that PIO Network is primarily commercial; its private companies its very few public Q:What a good resource though!When this kind of thing happensM:I know Youve got Haliburton there youve got BP youve got all these major corporationsEnergyM:A lot of them specialize in crisis management Q:They doM:If they have a spill or something like thatQ:Thats totally what it isM:But this PIO Network meets every odd month of the year the second Thursday or third Thursday But anyway they did a social media debrief and they had Red Cross come in and share what they had seen They had a few other different groups come in But again its very very high level It didnt dig down into some of these specificsLittle dynamicsM:But I could get you in touch with Francisco I bet you he could be a resourceQ:That sounds greatM:And I know Ekland from Red Cross she spoke on what the Red Cross did But a lot of it honestly too because this is a large group it was a bit of everyone showing offQ:Thats usually the case M:And it really wasnt as helpful as I think inner agency me talking with a couple other people going okay what was the real scoop Because Ill give you my crap and you can give me your crapWell and you talk to the people too high up M:No they want to sterilize  My question is were your boots wet M:Yeah exactlyThen we can talk to you Q:No that is really trueM:Francisco Sanchez is one that I want to get you in touch with I also wrote down on here for you to ask me about Constable Wayne Thompson Q:OkayM:Do you know Wayne Precinct 3 constable Good dude I know you guys are on the  [35:38] Waynes a really good dude Social media [nut] So he took over for the previous constable Constable [35:47] Thirty-year  [35:48] island constables there didnt talk to the sheriffs they were their own deal Wayne has come in and completely changed the agency since he was elected But he goes to almost every HOA meeting in his entire districtQ:Does he reallyM:He goes to half the [MUD] meetings I mean he is flipping crazy I don't know how his wife hasnt divorced himQ:Yeah it sounds that way M:But shes awesome She was just at a press conference that they had They did a drunk driving press conference and they invited us out And again this is something that Precinct 3 never used to do because we were sort of like  [36:24] small section He invited us community and Fort Bend EMS out just to have ambulances there He is phenomenal on social media He has a huge following Ill bet you he could put an ask out and get a bunch of people to respond either if we did do something at the fire stations admin building he could send folks up Or maybe he would be willing to have it because he works out of the Fort Bend Tax Assessor annex at 99 and West ParkQ:Yeah I tried to drive over thereM:Oh yeah When it was floodingQ:Yeah when it was flooded M:Yes Well so out of that annex is where he offices And so it might be worthwhile if you did one of these again maybe he would be willing to host something over there And again honestly the first time someone said this to me I was like is that a [running story]Q:I know I knowM:And so Im glad I came; this was awesomeQ:I am tooM:But the first two times I saw this I was like So finally I was okay Im gonna check this out either way But I think if this kind of thing was sponsored by or hosted by Precinct 3 or [PFC48] you might get more people to come out and at least assume some more validity thats  [37:39]Obviously this [37:41] if you havent noticed itM:Yeah I think thatd be great tooA lot of schools M:If the City of Katy hosted it wed be happy to send If you decide that theres only one time you can come out and Chuck wants to do it instead of us well send people that way as well Or whatever space M:However yeah Well figure out where and howQ:Let me give some thought about the best way Ill tell you the people Im missing from the data set right now Im missing senior citizensF:Okay Senior citizens using social media for rescuesQ:Or even ones who somebody acted on their behalfF:I can give you some namesM:YeahQ:So I do not haveF:People who were rescuedQ:People who were rescued who are senior citizensF:I mean I helped with one I can give you their contact information right nowQ:That would be super helpfulM:Matt can as well because he prioritized medical and seniors and children when he was doing all his stuff Q:Okay Thats the one group that Im missingF:Its interesting because again just a few years ago they werent on social mediaQ:I know they werent They werent and actually a mix of the two: people who are on and who arent would be really helpfulM:Well the people were dogging on Nextdoor for the posting of information But the internal communication and need for help was helpful there; we just couldnt see it at our levelQ:Thats what Ive heard from other communitiesM:And I wish I could have said there was if youre talking to Nextdoor that would be I wish there was a function for please let official because theres agency levels And really pretty much its only fire and law enforcement and then occasionally like Ive helped some MUDs get agency platforms in case theres ever a water emergency so they can talk to their folks They dont openly promote that theyll do that but as I said the fire department [Alyssa] whos my contact Nextdoor was like I can make it happen for us But when we did that we found out that a lot of seniors went to Nextdoor They didnt [like] Facebook because everyone can see it But they were okay with their neighbors and so they were willing to get on Nextdoor but they wouldnt touch any other social media because that felt more private to themQ:And privacy matters a lot more to that generation so that is importantF:Yes And they dont understand the language being used sometimes as well So this person is [Janet Core] and this is her cell phone number and she is I don't know do you have an age that you're calling senior citizenQ:No Im notF:Im sure shes late 60s Q:Thats fineF:7705 So her name is Janet Core and its with an E on the end Shes the one that I was telling you literally was rescued by using Facebook telling her kids help sending out the message And then I used Facebook to find her address to figure out what exact street she needed to go on to get right I looked on posts I looked on her kids posts and her friends posts And sometimes people check in and you can narrow it down and thats the stuff that I used I was like 90% sure which street but I wasnt 100% So thats how I found themQ:Thats pretty amazingF:And then they got a I think they were on kayaks at that point And got over to himM:Its amazing the amount of stalking tricks and things people have come up withF:Well Ill tell you an unutilized resource and Brian can tell you about this is Harris County has a real-time crime center that will use social media to track down  Q:Thats what I figuredF:But they cant  M:Talk about itF:Use it for emergency response Im like why That makes no sense So you have these people  hell tell you about it in much greater detail  who have expertise What they can do is like what you see on movies Its insane Its classified; I dont know all the specifics but I know what theyve done They have found people who robbed banks within ten minutes using pictures that other citizens are taking and they pinpoint the location of the criminal And they catch them and they get them Why are they not using that team when it comes to real-timeM:We asked that and the answer I got on this situation was its too big For instance we had a mass casualty event three years ago It wasnt [Sheiks] but it was an Indian religion Theres this group of people who were doing a ceremony in the upper level of a garage they put 200 people in the garage and of course it collapsed There were 35 people we had to transport Well originally when it was mentioned foreigners 30-some people blah blah blah blah blah Harris Count later told us in debrief that they dropped a net over the area And so if somebody mentions anything with sort of key words it pings and they collect all that data It was amazing some of the stuff that they shared with us I cant share all of it but it was wild But we asked about the same thing and they said that system is best utilized for a 5 10 maybe 20-mile radius Theyve used it for 50 but you cant drop a net over Houston because theres too much coming in You couldnt collect billions maybe NSA could F:Yeah good point Because we are talking about a small number of people Three or four analysts on at a time thats it M:So you want to drop something over the city of Katy you could drop it over the city of Katy They can literally collect every piece of data that ever hits a tower It is  [43:32] But its for limited use Its generally only for crime solving or that kind of thingF:So Brian supervised that unit Q:Really Okay Ill make a note of that tooF:Make a note of thatM:We need to catch up and do lunch or just a family dinner Well invite you guys over Q:Can I ask you a huge favorF:Yeah sure SureQ:You were actually here right after I gave out the informed consentF:YesQ:I need to make sure that youre okay with thatF:YeahQ:And then the only other thing I would love for you to do is could you give me a pseudonymF:YesQ:Or Ill make one up for youF:I have a fun oneQ:You doF:Thats a family one GenevieveQ:Thats great F:I have no idea why but Well I do Its really  Q:And then I have four demographic questions if you would answer for me I would sure appreciate it Just those right down there A B C D M:If you really want a pseudonymQ:Ill make one up for you Its really no big dealM:I always use Kaylas whenever IQ:Kaylas okayM:K-A-Y-L-A-SQ:Oh good Thats a nice unique oneM:And then  [44:36]Q:Yeah Because a lot of times what I have to do is  [44:39] name is I tack on the location or some kind of additional thing to make the name distinctM:If it helps if theres a benefit to having any official capacity Im happy for you to use Simon If youre just using it for general stuff and you want to do a pseudonym just for uniformity thats fine too Q:That would be wonderfulM:I told Chief that I was gonna come check this out and see what it was all about so Ill debrief himQ:And then Ill follow up with you because once were back in school once Im back from Florida Ive arranged my teaching schedule where all my classes are on Wednesdays So it gives me the possibility to come for two days on a Monday or a Tuesday or two days on a Thursday or a Friday And so I am coming back And Im also very interested and Im gonna think a lot more about this interorganizational agency connection idea that you had because we have a huge theres a huge body of research literature in exactly my area on that issue But that research doesnt get to them  [45:43]Q:But the big problem we have and Im as guilty of it as anybody is that academics are rewarded for writing academic articles And then theyre not understandable by anybody but academicsOr accessible When was the last time you were interviewed  [45:58]Q:Yeah Its just not So one of the things that Im actually committed to working on I have a group of PhD students right now that Im training to write translational articles And the whole idea is to partner up with a faculty member have an interview with him and then translate into common language because I have always had a commitment to making sure that my work is accessible And so even when people read my research theyre number one comment is wow this is very readable Until you get to the methods section and then its all this gobbledygook and stat stuff and crazy You all thank you so very much This is beyond my wildest dreams in terms of the ideas youve givenEND OF RECORDING2
