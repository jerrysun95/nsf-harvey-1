is your house in I'm just north of Canyon Gate You are I'm just across the bayou from Canyon GateOkay We are behind the elementary school which also got flooded I saw that You saw that right It was a kind of  [00:00:18] the blue things going around it We are just behind it So you wanted to know the rescue part or you wanted to know the repair part More rescue Rescue part Okay all right So I guess it wasI guess we heard about that there would be a pretty bad rain coming but I didnt expect it would be that bad So I think it was Thursday Iit was a few days already So Thursday I went to store and pretty much everythings gone The water is gone Yeah everythings gone So I was like oh people is overreacting So Friday it started raining I had a lunch arrangement with a friend so we even joked about it: Its just everybodys overreacting And then we heard that the school is going to close and we were like Oh whats the big deal So I think Friday it started raining Saturday Sunday it was raining really hard And so we look atI look at the WeChat and peopleI think I looked at WeChat quite a bit and then I have friends call me They checked the elevation site and they said Hey your elevation looks pretty bad And I never heard about it I didnt know about my elevation until my friend told me And they said Thats the website You should go check I was thinking that maybe we couldnt go out for a few days I didnt think that we would be flooded So I cook all the food so I was likeso we don't go out and then well just eat And then we look at it online We check on the YouTube We check on the WeChat We block all the doors right Yes right And then we also started moving furniture upstairs I think that wasnt until probably Monday I think it wasso Saturday we didnt think of it too much But the water started rising on the street so we knew kind of we couldnt go out I think actually Saturday my son still go out My older son still went out but on the way back they got all scared because there was a big deep puddle of water and they have to kind of detour So they got a little scared So that was Saturday Sunday still raining so we check our TV The TV was on the whole time And we check online We check the WeChat And I think it was Sunday night I think it stopped raining So I had a little hope that the waterat that time Sunday the water is already like in the middle of our lawn And so the night it stopped raining we thought it would go down But Monday morning when I got up and looked at it it didnt go down much at all Thats when I got worried because I thought it wentit stopped raining It should go down quite a bit What happened is all the rainwater from west from north come down to our area come down to the reservoir and the reservoir did not release water so the water didnt go down And then it started raining again So we did some more work We kind of block all the weep holes around the house and then we start moving furniture I have my older son and the younger son I'm a single mom They were really helpful so they helped to move most of the furniture the furniture that is light enough for them to carry They even carried up big very nice sofa upstairs So the whole second floor is all full Then we kind ofwe have a big Yamaha piano and so we wrapped all the legs and all the dining table legs and all that So we did quite a bit But we still hoped that we wouldnt need to go I think it was around probably 6:00 or 7:00 I think the lowest point of the house the sewage water started coming in So it smelled really bad So I was like it doesnt look good I don't think I wanted to stay in the house The water is already kind of close to the front door And then it gets above the front door So around 8:00 I think its above the front door but it didnt come in right away So we were still thinking: Oh maybe we will be okay since the work we did There was boats coming in and out Its getting dark So I was kind of debating whether we need to leave Some friendsanother lady in the neighborhood (shes French) and we kind of keep talking and she said she decided to leave I think I called a few neighbors and I couldnt get into touch with them so I think that they are leaving already Then we saw the water coming At that moment we felt like we shouldnt stay And there was a boat Our street is like a dead end thats pretty deep [00:07:13] So we saw a boat going By the time they come out we told them that we wanted to leave And so they pulled up to the driveway close to the garage Basically we all packed one backpack so my kids had all their backpacks ready But I have my computer out because I was checking stuff At that moment I didnt bring my computer I just pick up my backpack And thats actually the backpack It looks pretty nasty I havent had a chance to wash it So that is the backpack It was dirty Then that was the only backpack that we could find for my to go to Boy Scout campout So he made it even dirtier [laughter] Exactly Oh goodness So I only had that and I have one set of clothes because they are waiting for us and we are kind of just rush and all the doors are already blocked with sandbags on the outside So we actually leave through the window Did you Wow My kids with sandals They gave me the only pair of rain boots They are very sweet They said Mom you wear this So its huge because its their rain boots so its huge So we left the house in a big rush I went to the garage to turn off the switch Uh-huh the electricity Yeah So then we left So I have some pictures if you wantThat would be extremely helpful So basically they came from Brandon They don't know where to go So theyre kind of stuck here and stuck there And we were like Oh this is supposed to be a road Because you really don't know where the road is But you can only see the signs on both sides of the street Its like Okay so this is supposed to be a road We shouldnt stay in the middle Middle usually theres a bump Middle is the shallow water Sometimes they get stuck They said We need to go to the side Wow What kind of boat Was it an airboat Its a mechanical boat It had a motor on the back So they had to watch the prop and they had to keep it deep Thats right So we get out of the subdivision and we get on the street At that time I think the water is even deeper We ran the red light [laughter] So they were joking Hey we ran the red light It was another family the mom and the son It was the French woman So she said she was going to leave but she didnt leave until that time So when we got on the boat they were there So we went and we saw the middle school and we took pictures and then we saw a big yellow truck a really high big truck and it was in the water for a whole day and it was dead So we went some blocks north and I think the water gets too shallow so we got off and we walked a little bit more There are people kind of helping us carry the bag for me It was raining So we walked a little bit We walked kind of close toI think its North Mason where theres a bridge school [00:11:34] Its south of Westheimer Okay It gets pretty dry There was kind of almost like a staging area People with big trucks all came and they all parked there and the people come to me said Do you need help Do you need help I said Yeah yeah yeah We need to go to our friends house That guy is local and he lives west of 99 He said I just have to come out He said I just cannot stay home and watch TV Very nice He brought towels clothes like everything Hes like Where do you want to go So I gave him one address I told you earlier He said That place doesnt look very good It got flooded The second address I called my friend and they said they already host a family The third one said Please come So we went Even when we went there there was a car stuck in the water like right outside the subdivision and that guy go scared and was like Am I supposed to go So I called my friend and my friend said No problem We don't have any water Please come The husband actually started walking out of his house to come to get us So this guy finally he just gradually drive through the water and took us to our friends house So we lived there for three days Like every day we watched news we check online and we started to see that some areas become mandatory evacuation A friend of mine was stuck in Canyon Gate She has a one-story house Her husband and her was staying in the attic So that one night I think it was Tuesday nightwe evacuated Monday night So Tuesday night we all tried to get them out So there was a boat coming in and out We sent out a rescue kind of plea on WeChat You did Okay Yeah I don't know whether they did Facebook At that time we know about that theres a few Chinese groups that they have boats They operate boats to rescue people And of course there are a lot ofI know that theres people from Austin from Dallas and there are people from north like South Lake They have boats and they all came I think it was Tuesdaywas it Tuesday night or Monday night Then they expanded the evacuation area by mistake It was a mistake Was it It was a mistake They expanded They included two subdivisions west of 99 A friend of mine lives in that neighborhood and I saw that and I know kind of for sure its a mistake And a friend of mine also a  [00:15:34] works at  in the flood office So I send her that information I said That looks like a mistake to me That was like 2:00 in the morning I didnt want to tell people Its a mistake because thats too much responsibility right Exactly But I sent it to her and I said That looks like a mistake And she checked and she said It is a mistake Wow But it was like 3:00 in the morning I wouldnt have wanted to tell my friend Its a mistake And I thought that probably nobodys actually watching But at 6:00 7:00 TV said it was a mistake Then later on I found out my friend was packing and some people just left Katy [laughter] Of course right It was just chaos on top of chaos And then I think it wasI think the rain stopped The rain stopped I think Monday night Monday nightSunday night or Monday night they started releasing the reservoir And so by Wednesday we kind of all went out tried to get back in but we couldnt get back Thursday we couldnt get back in So I think it was Friday I think Wednesday we tried to go back also from the social media that they said there are trucks the government trucks the military trucks that could send people in Was it Wednesday I think it might be WednesdayWednesday or Thursday So we went there And they staged at like Westheimer and Mason But they wouldnt let us in unless its like you have a pet you left a pet there or you need some medicine We don't have that kind of situation It takes an extremely long time to go there because they pick up maybe a bunch of people and they all live in different places They have to go to different subdivisions and then they have to find their place They are allowed only like two minutes in their house only two minutes And they were following If you pick up something not like life/death important thing they said Put it down Really Yeah It has to be medicine or dog or something So you waited for hours and hours to get into your house for two minutes Okay Then they have to go around the neighborhood so it take a long time So we couldntwe were not allowed to go anywhere Then we met a couple They were just evacuating then So I believe it was a Wednesday We were like Really You stayed for that long They said Yeah no problem We lived upstairs We even cooked [laughter] Oh my gosh Wow So it was pretty funny So I think on Thursday we tried again My son was in line for a long time Then we understand its only two minutes and said Forget about it So they went this summer volunteer work They went to church and they did some [inaudible] [00:19:30] I think it was a Friday we actually checked this house I talked to my friend in China I was like Can I live in your house for a while And she said No problem This house has been vacant for quite some time They are ex-pats They live in Shanghai Beijing and Shanghai my friend from church and I'm pretty good friends I said Well can we live in it She said No problem So everythings set up well I think it was September 1st I believe that we moved in September 1st I think it was a Friday We lived in another friends house where we evacuated They treat us so well and we didnt have to cook We didnt have to do anything Yeah September 1st was Friday And nobody go to work Nobody go to school So we had a good time I didnt have to cook So it was actually almost like a vacation But we know that we need toand I kind of figured it would take a long time for us to go back so we decided to come here So Friday we moved to here September 1st So we moved here and then kind of the reality kicks in We think about it: Well how do we go back What are we going to do Some places its already accessible but not my neighborhood So people were talking about getting boats and all that So it wasI think I started working on that At that time it was Saturday I kind of talked to my friends and got two boats for Sunday Saturday they were already booked all day The boats are booked The boats for Memorial area So you have to tell people ahead of time to book the boats right So I have two boats reserved for Sunday And Sunday we are supposed to go to church I was like No I cannot go to church Sunday we have one kayak one other boat Its kind of like almost a rectangular boat Its a paddleboat Paddleboat Really Huh Yeah And then I told them that we need to go in and ask whether anybody has a life jacket because I'm just afraid because my kids will go I asked about it and one of the church friends said Ive got a life jacket for you I think Saturday she went to Academy no life jacket And she went to Walmart no life jacket I guess she didnt go to Academy because it was already closed So she said I go in the morning When do you need to go Ill buy it before you go Ill get it for you It was like Also get some sticks for me because I heard that some people get electricYes we heard right So we said Get some sticks in case… [laughter] Was it Sunday or was it Saturday Even just boats you need to have a truck to get the boats here So I ask a friend who has a truck to get the boats for me Then Sunday we all met I have two friends two male friends and they took my two boys My younger one was like Hey Justin how about you just stay home Mommy and Michael go ahead No no no I need to go We also get them the suit The waders The waders yeah So we also get that borrow that so they have that and the life jacket At that time the reason for that is I need to get my computer out And I think theres a few things that we need to get out So they went Even then we have thisour neighborhood has a WeChat group and the people were asking about boats and all that I said Well Ive got two boats If you want to come you can come So another neighbor come who was waiting on the boat We said We have to make two trips And at that time we were kind of staging at the middle school  [00:24:53] Am I speaking too much Its great No its fine Yeah Its just incredible just theFry Road pretty much from 99 all the way to Mason where theres the water the car cannot go through Its just lined up with cars because people wants to go back So its all lined up Both sides of the road is all cars And then the middle school the back the whole parking lot is full and its mud everywhere Its mud Its justyou cannot imagine just now Its just mud everywhere and its wet All the cars nice cars covered by dust and mud on the wheels on the doors So we went there and unload the boats so my kids get there get in They went to my house Then there are boats going around Theres volunteers And its a whole week after the rain Its a Sunday And theyre still in boats Oh yeah Wow So its a Sunday Monday we evacuated So it was a Sunday Then mythere was volunteers having the boat going around So I got on one boat So he took me to where the elementary school is And then at the one spot that is really dry the boat cannot go through so I have to walk Then I called my friends house I said Hey I'm here Please come pick me up So they got the boat and[laughter] Oh my gosh They brought a boat to pick you up on the other side of the dry spot Wow They come pick me up and I saw people walking on the street and the water is up here up to here And I wouldnt dare to walk on that kind of water And so we went in My son already got the computer for me I took some pictures I took pictures of my house It had the nice reflection on the water And then I actually went to my friends house also I wanted to kind of update her about her house so I took pictures of that And then we went back to my house Then we pick up a few things Then I remember something I was like Oh the food in the refrigerator must be bad So we opened it It smelled really bad We dump everything in the trash bag So we did all that The house the water is out but its all muddy I had like engineered wood floor Its just dirty and muddy So we left That was Sunday right And then I heard that people is going to start cleaning the next day which is Labor Day So that night I was still thinking theres no way for me to start cleaning because we could not even get in So I was like oh we couldnt get in So that was Sunday And they were talking about it Our church organized the cleaning crew There was two houses that would be cleaned And people from Sugar Land is going to help and people from Katy would help So I thought no were not going to do it But then the Monday morning a guy from my kids Boy Scout troop contact us and said Are you okay Do you need any help And I was like Oh we couldnt really access our house yet And he said Well theres another family in your neighborhood and we are going to help them So I was like Oh really And I was like Okay When we visit our house we already saw mold in our couch That couch wasthe water is not that high to reach the top of the couch but just because it sucked all the water in the top of the couch is alreadyits a leather sofa Theres mold already So it looksI know its going to get really bad very soon very fast So I was like Okay then lets do it Lets go clean So I called our church Theres one organizer And I said We are going to start cleaning He was like Oh we don't have people because we already arranged all the people Okay I get some people So I said Okay please get some people And I also talked to my friends who are in Katy whos already starting repair And I said We are going to start cleaning also Could you send some people over So probably around lunchtime people started showing up people from like Bellaire people from like Memorial area They start to show up At that time we have to transport  [00:31:13] My older son haswe kept the kayak So he would kayak and take the people to my house And my younger son he has these big rain boots and he pushed the wheelbarrow with all the tools and all that and walked along like peoples front yard and back yard and went back to my house It took an hour to walk back with another family I was kind of directing people where to go which boat to get on So when the people come to my house they didnt know what to do because I was not there So they call me and they said Hey you should go back You need to tell us what to do And my phone was running out of battery It was just really chaotic They have thosesome people has their own truck really high truck and taking people and theres a Jeep I saw a few people that I know from our Boy Scout troop They took some friends in for me Then later they called me and said I need to go back I got one Jeep He actually went like the back road all the way; just go around and around  think he didnt take me all the way Did he take me all the way back Anyway so I went back They already started cleaning I was able to put a big cover on my baby grand Oh were you Was it okay People already started putting like a knife and hammer on the piano right So I was able toI think it was a Saturday or Sunday I bought a big cover plastic cover for that so I was able to put that How did you protect the legs Well you guys all should remember how to do it And do you have a picture Because I am fascinated by how people protected some of their furniture I hope I have a picture yeah I bought a lot of trash bags ahead of time because we were thinking about putting sandbags in front of the house So I bought a lot of trash bags So I had the trash bags big trash bags 30 gallon and wrap up the leg all the way to the bottom of the piano the body So that was probably two three feet probably So put it all the way up and then tape it Wow And it protected 'em Only one leg somehow the bag was broken but the other two legsand also the piece that you step on when you play we wrapped that so it did not get any water in Wow thats amazing Yeah so thats a very good way I saw people put bricks up Thats not high enough So definitely we invented that [laughter] Thats great The funniest one Ive seen isand funny I say in an uncomfortable way because they showed me a picture of Dixie cupsnot Dixie cups but the Solo cups those red plastic cups and they had gone around and they had put all their furniturethey had put one of these little cups on the legs of all their furniture and they took pictures and they told me that they were so proud of themselves for coming up with this But then of course they got four feet of water in their house and so that was pretty useless But thats interesting That is so fascinating Its good that that worked for you I don't have the picture right here because I took so many pictures my phone keep running out of memory Yes I understand that So I have to kind ofWell maybe Yaguan [00:36:10] could look Heres our project What we have is we have a dedicated phone thats nothing but for our project and so one way that we can dowe did this with someone earlier today We looked through pictures and pictures that you were comfortable sharing that might help us with the project We can do an Airdrop and get them fairly quickly that way directly to our project phone M:Airdrop cable I don't think I can get it very soon because its not on myIts not on your phone Its not on my phone anymore because I have to transfer to my computer I can look for some of them and find it and then send it to you You can also send to that email just whatevers most convenient for you Its also a dedicated email just for the project Okay I think I probably could find it in the stream Oh okay Let me see Its quite a bit to go through So some of the images that were looking for iswhenever you were talking aboutyou took pictures when you were on the boat You took pictures of your house You took pictures of your yard of how you tried to protect things in your house Anything like that is really helpful for us Okay Its quite amazing I can only imagine We have some good pictures actually got some really good pictures Not all of them are here Let me show you one picture Great Ill come over there if you want and just look over your shoulder This picture isI think it was on Sunday when we went back and I actuallythis guy gave me a ride out and he is from Austin Hes from Austin You can see theres still water behind us That was on the street Oh my gosh Thats on the street a week after That was on the street yeah Thats so amazing Yeah I think thatsokay this one you probably could recognize it That was the paddleboat that were talking about That was Sunday My younger son and my friendthis is close to the elementary school So thats where we go back how we went back Let me see… Are they gonna be able to do anything with that elementary school Have you heardI don't know So thats I think they took a picture when they went back Thats the paddleboat Thats a street It still has that much water on it Wow Thats right Thats our neighborhood yeah So it doesntI actually took a picture yeah when we went back When we went backthis is our housethats how it looked This is how it looks Theres still water in the house I don't think this isokay Thats September 3rd Thats Sunday Thats a Sunday Thats right So September 1st we moved here So yeah it does have all theso I remembered You did You remembered your days well I remembered the days So thats ourthats September 3rd also See This is our front door We have all those bags kind of tried to protect it But it doesnt really help When the water goes that high ever time the boat come over it would justThe wake of the boat The wave is just push it and then go back Thats how it is So it doesnt really help at all Oh thats so true So yeah I think I can look through it and send you some pictures How about that That would be fine Yeah That sounds good The ones that you have there do you wanna click a few of those and just Airdrop them quickly and then maybe help us with whatever else you think would be helpful for us These are pretty fast to Airdrop Have you ever done that before Yes I did it before Well youre better than me I learned how to do Airdrop as part of this project I didnt even know what it was Yes I guess I could Yeah I think my photo streamthats something that I don't quite understand I delete all the photos but it still show up in the photo stream M:Right but you can opt out of that function Oh is that right M:Its by default Okay So it still takes up my memory; is that right M:You can go to iCloud after and just turn off that streaming Turn off the streaming function okay Yeah so thats why I kind ofM:So you can select a few I can select this one M:Yeah so you basically go and select things that you want And then after all that you click [Chinese spoken] Okay all right Let me look at this picture What is this picture Oh I don't know Is that my neighborhood or where We have all the water right You are interested Isnt thatYeah and then anything else that you have that shows what you did to anything inside the house to get ready Ill tell you another thing You mentioned something a while ago and I thought if you had an image of that it would be really helpful You were talking about on Friday meeting with your friends and yall talking about this being hyped up and nothing was gonna happen Thats a very common theme that I'm hearing from people And I even had one woman actually in Cinco Ranch who has a picture Shes sitting there with her feet propped up and a glass of wine next to her She took this picture and she told usshe said I was saying Oh I didnt buy in a flood plain Nothings gonna happen to me And then she has this series of pictures that show as the water is coming up She said I just couldnt believe it I just couldnt believe it was happening So imagines that help us understand the unfolding of the fact this happened over several days would be really helpful anything like that And then of course things that help us identify water thats there what it looks like when its real when people really do need to be rescued Things like are really helpful too I think the unfolding partI'm not sure whether we have a picture Okay Not everybody does So I guesssee thats another picture That wasI think it was a Tuesday It was a Monday or Tuesday when the repair was already starting Thats the water on the street Its still there Still there So the water on the street was five feet deep I think at the worst time See thats September 4th so that was Monday My friends come to help and when they leave they get on the FEMA truck to leave That would be really helpful The FEMA truck yeah Thats my driveway so that was still that deep Water is still that deep And I actually have a very nice picture of them leaving See this one Oh thats good Wow Its just hard to believe Yeah And I have even a better picture Its good for me but I don't know whether forthis is all the friends from our church They are leaving With the masks With the masks yeah So at that time everybody has a mask I guess Ill pick a few Okay that would be really great So this one… So you want a more scenery picture or more people picture Probably more scenery People can be in it thats absolutely fine But I'm more interested in what it looks like Okay I think I picked five pictures Look at those and see if theres anything that mightThis one M:Yeah And then Airdrop Here this one M:Yeah If you have others I would lovewere trying to capture as many of the real images as we possibly can so please feel free You can email 'em to that email You can text 'em Whatevers most convenient Sure definitely Now all my contact info is on the other side But the stuff thats on the back is dedicated or the project Okay I see Great Well this has been incredibly helpful I guess I just had a couple of other kinda quick questions Did you ever call 911 or did you ever contact any official sources to get rescued No You just saw the boats and realized nows the time Yeah Yeah I'm hearing that a whole lot from people Let me see if there was anything else that we had So you mentioned WeChat You mentioned possibly some Facebook also Yeah Especially when you were posting calls for help for other people right I believe so
