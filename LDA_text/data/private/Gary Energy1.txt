Harry EnergyQ:…ask you to give me a pseudonym It can be just any first namefirst and last namethats not your own but its what Ill track kind of your information with So any name you wantA:Harry is okay Q:That works All right so I will put Harry in here Wonderful So Id like for you to start off by kind of telling meyou were in the subdivision you were in that flooded and kind of tell your story about what happenedA:Okay So it was Sunday morning We were watching the rain Streets were starting to get flooded but not in the house yet So my wife took a picture and put it on Facebook that Hey the water is all the way to the front door maybe another few feet away And then suddenly our friends starting calling Hey Raoul its dangerous and some people said Hey the streets are flooded don't evacuate Some friends said No you should evacuate But then there was one friend his name is CK he kind of pushed us that Hey they might open the flood gates and its gonna get worse so its better to evacuate now So we were still in the limbo so I went out myself I went over in my front of the house I wanted to walk and see how the streets are see if we can even drive out So I went and immediately the water was chest high and there was no way cars could get out Q:Yes Ive been in that subdivisionA:Yes So that being said then this friend offered Hey I can bring the boat and then we can evacuate He started driving with his boat but then his streets were flooded and he couldnt drive out And then I guess he found another friend of histhis is back through social mediathat he was already on the road and helping some victims with evacuation So he connected with ushim to usand then we said Okay Maybe we will try to walk out to the main street which is Memorial Drive and go from there But I knew my daughter is 4 tall so she is gonna be fully underwater She cannot walk But then we try to findI mean thats when I did some dry runs in the sense I walked and tried to find shallow water close to peoples house And there were some spots but luckily there we only chest high for my daughter So we were able to navigate and then towards the end wherever front gate is the water again was too high but it was like a 10 long distance where the water was highLuckily there was a family who had a boat They saw our daughter struggling They said Hey your daughter can use the boat And finally we off of the boat and then my friends friends came and picked us up Okay Thats my daughterQ:Oh thats great You want me to let them inA:So and then we were able to evacuate so I think the credit goes to like my wife putting the pictures Then my friend seeing it Then hes connecting to another friend so thats an example of how connection connection worked outQ:Yeah and thatsyeahA:And Im glad we did that because next morning our house was flooded with 5 of water So it was a good decision in hindsightQ:Yes it really was Hi how are yallA:Thats my wife AngelieQ:Hi Im Sherry nice to see youIm RhiaQ:Hi Rhia How are you doingGoodQ:Good Well thank yall so much for joining us I really appreciate itYeah Q:So I hear youre eight is that rightYesQ:So I have an 18-year-old now but I still remember when she was about 8 Actually its going super She is a phenomenal 18-year-old and were looking at colleges right now Shes a great kid so I feel really fortunate And I have a 14-year-old also a boy And I will survive that Hes also awesome I cant say anything at all Hes actually a rock climber and we come down to Katy to that new gym pretty regularly if you know anything about rock climbing So were actually in the Houston area a fair bit with him climbingA:All rightQ:Yeah So thank you so much Your dad was just telling me about your evacuation and the fact that you put a picture on social media and said Hey look its coming up to ourthe front of our houseYeahQ:And then a friend said Let me come get you with a boat but couldnt get into the neighborhood connected you to another friend of his Was that through social media alsoNo they know each other so my friend has a boat but the water was not deep enough so he couldnt get his boat So he called his other friend who has a truck Hes like Okay I have my friend stuck there can you just go up pick them up So it was just word-of-mouthQ:Oh wow and was it originally Facebook where you posted the picture originallyYesA:Thats when CK called you rightYeah thats when my friends were like Yeah youre going to get out of that place Youre not going to stay there anymoreQ:Yeah And so yall werent there long enough for you to lose power or did you still have powerA:Yeah by the time we left yes we still had power Then around midnightaround 2:00 am exactly when they opened the gates then the 4 wave came But they disconnected the power around 7:00 pm same night so we left around noon _[00:06:02] personally evacuated in the neighborhood What had happened was at the Tax Day weekend we had similar flooding but our backyard flooded but the water never got in So we all were pretty optimistic in the neighborhood thinking that oh this will be a similar situation So everybody was taking it easy But we wanted to just get out of the house because we didn't want to lose the power and get stuck and not be able to… We never thought when we were leaving the house that this house would be flooded That wasnt in our mind So we didn't move anything like Oh this is the same thing We might lose power lets just get outQ:Okay Wow What did you take with you when you evacuated what were you able to carry with youRhias moccasinA:Just two backpacksJust clothes and the passports Q:Yeah And your cell phones I guessA:Yeah so cell phone iPad and chargers were the most important Q:Its so funny I hear that a lotA:Yes And then passports and then one pair of clothes thats itNo two We didn't pair of clothes Only she had pair of clothesQ:Oh gosh wowA:Oh thats true yeah just one pajama _[00:07:18]I was traveling I was in California and then when I heard about this I came back Thursday I really wanted to come back be home not because I was stressing out like I just wanted to be with my family Q:Yes I understandSo I came back and I was not in anyI was pretty zoned out likeand I took _[00:07:43] like to come back I came back in the morning around 4:00 am so I really didn't think about packing or anything And we are not citizens we are permanent residents so passportyesQ:Yeah _[00:07:57] rightSo the passports are the most important the VISAs Q:Of courseSo in the backpackwe had two backpacksone backpack we put all of our essential documents and in one backpack we put things thats essential for her and some cereal bars and an iPad and a pair of clothesQ:Wow And then how high did the water get for you when you were walking outSix feetQ:WowShe would not be able to walk outA:The last patch is when the family offered the boatYeahQ:Yeah Were there a lot of boats around already whenever you werenot yetA:No just one It was a family boat yes I think that family what they were doing is they were also evacuating just their kids to the grandparents but they were gonna stay in the house So they were just transporting their kids on Memorial DriveIt was actually not _[00:08:55] like a floatie They have a swimming poolA:Inflatable yeahQ:Oh yesSo we were just fortunate while we got walking out and I already had water to my knees And I actually had a talk with _[00:09:11] We had a talk with her and I said You will keep going and following daddy because I don't swim Im not good with water Shes a pretty good swimmer He can survive So I said Youre going to follow daddy no matter what and mommy will make it _[00:09:28] reach to the ground and I actually said You will keep going and reach up to the high ceiling yeah And we were fortunate when we are going out we saw another lady she was wearing a running shirt Said Come Ill help you I just dropped off my kids at the gate and the grandparents are going to take care She has a swimming pool and she has a floatie So Rhia sat in the floatie and I _[00:09:55] at one point actually almost fell down but thats just me because I was freaking outQ:Oh my goodnessBecause the waters been out there I don't know whats in the water and there were electric poles thereQ:Yes that is very scary So just to let yall know even though Imthis is research that I do When I was in the third gradeso I was pretty close to your agemaybe exactly what grade are you inThirdQ:So when I was in the third grade I lived on thein North Central Texas on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River and we received a call that they were letting water out the river and that our house might be flooded And we all said No way it doesnt ever flood here Its never had water before And then literally as it started coming over the road people came and pulled us out of the house and rescued us And we had 5 of water in our house for two weeks which sounds very much like a lot of people in your neighborhoodA:Thats true yeahQ:And so the house that I grew up in my parents didn't have insurance and so we ended upand they had just built a brand new home that they couldnt afford because theyre both public school teachers And so my whole life I knew I was gonna have to put myself through college because we werent gonna have enough money to send me to college because they were paying on two mortgages I mean the good news is that we made it through you know and it probably made us closer as a family But I was exactly your age and so part of the reason that this research I think has added meaning for me is that its helping people who went through what I went through when I was your age And you know what it made me really strong in a lot of ways I think Im thinking back now as an adult how many things I do differently because I went through that I mean its a horrible experience but you make it through rightMm-hmmQ:And you get to stay at a wonderful place This is beautiful Im amazed So are yallare yall rebuildingA:Yes Luckily we had flood insuranceQ:You did thankfullyA:That might be the only good decision I made last yearQ:You know thatsyeah thats great news actually A:So anyway so luckily financially at least it should take care of most of it but we still have our emotional stuff to go throughQ:Oh absolutelyA:YeahQ:Absolutely Well thats good so whats the timing on you being able to get backA:The end of AprilQ:Oh wow thats not badA:YeahQ:Okay Good And you probably go to school close to this area so it was nice to get to stay pretty closeYeah same schoolQ:Same school thats great That is great All right Well so one of the things in this study that Im very interested in is what it looks like to post those calls for help on social media and then the role that social media plays So Im very curious do you happen to have any of those posts that initial picture on your Facebook page or on something like thatI doQ:Because if thats something that I don't know you might post a ton to Facebook and it might take a while to scroll but if its at all possible if I could take some screenshots of what you posted that got people then contacting you and saying Wait that doesnt look… And then you also said that you were hearing reports that they were gonna release the flood gatesA:Yes Not me specifically but my friendQ:And thats also kind of interesting how people were getting their information so was your friend in the same neighborhood somewhere differentA:No a different neighborhood Its called Lakes of Parkway thats where he isQ:Okay So fairly closeA:Yes But I think that opening the gates was not very well communicated for at least people in our neighborhoodQ:Thats what Ive heardA:Yeah so there is a lady she lives alone in that next door house to us She had no idea right So first of all what they did is 7:00 pm the power is cut off And then 2:00 am is when they opened the gates so suddenly your houses are flooded And next day is when the federal and the rescue boats came knocking everybodys door to Hey this is the time to evacuate because this water will stay in the house for many days so you have to evacuate And then the lady was complaining It was not easy for her to come out right because 4 of water right So it was like last 4 upstairs were full of water So and the board doesnt go in so they have to come up with some ideas to send a floatie bring the lady down and then put her in the boat Q:Floaties thats you know Ive seen pictures of the floaties which are always kind of interesting So were you able to find thatYeah so you want to take the picturesQ:That would be great Were trying to get as many images of what these real things look like as possible So this is my project phone not my personal phone so if Im slow with it thats why Because Im not used toThis is just me ranting Do you need my rantingQ:I would love your rant because people saw thatReallyQ:Yeah because people will have seen that andA:Or you can take a screenshot and then text to her if that is possibleQ:You could text directly to my phone as a matter of factYeah we can doI will do thatQ:And then if you happen to have a bunch of picturesA:We have millions of picturesYou probably need like a _[00:15:26] No we have a lot of pictures because we had to show that for our insuranceQ:Thats what I would figure yes rightBut you can go ahead and take thisQ:Let me take one and then Ill have you text it to me and see if this is gonna give me…Yeah I think the lighting wouldQ:Yeah the lighting is kind of a challengeI will be more than happy to take screenshots and send it to youQ:That would be really greatYeah Okay Q:Heres the project cell phone number and that would be super helpful because one of the things that seems so different about this situation in Houstonand Im literally going to Florida in two weeks and everything Ive heard is different in Florida because it was neighbors helping neighbors here Oh yeahQ:And very much that way and so much of it was created by posts on social media And so seeing what those real posts look like that evoked peoples rescue efforts is really helpful because my hope is that in the future well be able to tell the difference between a real post for help and one thats not real And so by identifying all these real posts for help and understanding how quickly messages were sent to people and what this organizing acting action looks like thats what were hoping to do So that would be really great those images So the floaties seeing things like that seeing anything about boats And by the way when the images come to us they have to be stored in a confidential database so its not like they would even be used ever for public anything Its all just for our research So ifand Im super sensitive when there are kids in the picture They would never get out becauseYeah No I don't have her picture on thoseQ:Oh thats good See I do very similar things so Inow that mine are teenagers Ive lost control and theyre all over the internet but when they were younger I protected them so I understand that A:Can I ask you a quick questionQ:YesA:What is the objective of your research the one youre doingQ:Yeah its understanding calls for help on social media And so its understanding how people make those calls for help and how other people came and rescued them So related to that did yall ever call 9-1-1 or anything like thatA:NoQ:Because you got out early rightA:Yes we got out earlyQ:And so thats some of also what Im trying to understand is a lot of people called 9-1-1 later in the process but this was kind ofyou got out ahead before there was water in your houseA:Yes a day early yesYeah So the little background with that is my background and my graduate studies hydrology and hydraulics so Ive worked with the Harris County Flood Control _[00:18:04] so I know the Bayous and I know that And although Im not a hydrologist I have _[00:18:11] from that field but Ive worked in this field for like 8-10 years So when I started talking about the reservoir is going to release and I know they got two reservoirs I said Yeah at least well be losing power and we don't want to be in that way _[00:18:29] was little hesitant to get out of the house because of our past experience and it never flooded But somewhere in my hearts like okay I think I have seen some of the studies and the reservoirs fail we might have some issues So we just wanted to get out And of course another thing I wanted to tell on the Facebook because this is like Im on a lot of Facebook community pages _[00:18:58] So I usually don't post Im like not much of a Facebook person but I have these communities So if I put something on the Facebook I do get a lot especially even if I put a picture I do get a lot of response a) because I don't just try _[00:19:17] put pictures every day You know how people put picturesQ:Yes I doSo some of my friends said At least people responded to you Im screaming and yelling here and nobody responded to me So then I startedIm a data person myself so I was just trying to think about it and just like people don't take you so seriously if you have every day something like you know stuff going on And I was feeling sorry for her because she didn't get much helpQ:Wow thats so interestingAn interesting twistQ:And thats really helpful Its kind of like when you cry wolf is the phrase thats often used But over-posting means people arent paying as much of attention to youThey just scroll through it right like if you are hearing from somebody like say like a distant friend If shes calling you after like ten years you would pick up the call versus somebody who just calls you like every dayQ:Yeah thats so true Thats pretty interesting and very helpful I havent heard that but that makes complete sense that that would happen Were yall on the need platform for your communityA:Yes Q:And were yall early enough in the process where people werent posting things yet on need do you rememberNextdoor was more helpful to me after the flood about Hey what you guys doing and something like that FacebookIm not on Twitterwas more helpful in communicating fast I guess that media is like morereaching out to more people in less timeQ:Yeah makes sense Okay A:But Nextdoor had one advantage though at least you can get updates from people who are right next to you which Facebook doesntQ:RightIf you have a Memorial Thicket community Facebook _[00:21:18]A:But right now we didn't we did notWe didn't have a community pageA:Yeah In our community we have a lot of senior citizens in the sense that they may not be hooked to Facebook and Nextdoor on their phones rightQ:RightA:So yeah thats another complaint I heard that most of the residents in our community they were not able to access thisQ:Yeah and thats true And thats actually something I probablyI havent really met with anybody who is a true senior citizen and someone whose probably over 70 Ive caught some people who were in their 60s but they tend to be pretty progressive in how they use social mediaA:Okay goodQ:And so I think eventually Im gonna need to talk to some people who arent using it to get their voice because I think it was probably a different experience for them than thisA:Im sure yes I think Miss Shelly[00:22:05] might be one of thoseYeah and also Houston has a lot of immigrantsQ:Yes rightAnd like I could tell my dad is on Facebook He will post but my mom still doesnt So coming from third worldwe come from Indiacountries using an application is not very easy Shes somehow got hooked onto the WhatsApp but in Houston there a lot of people coming from third world countries if thats the right word to use This is still not hooked on to social media and apps yetQ:Yeah that makes sense Thats really helpful So Im curious anything else about if you were to define how that post was successful what made that post successful for youThe picture made it successful to me the picture made it successfulA:And I think your post its not like you were asking for help right you were just saying Hey guys the water is up to this levelI think _[00:23:08] for help yeah It was to like this is our situationA:The credit goes to our friend who kind of pushed us to evacuateYeah I would say like theI know this a very philosophical time but the bonding that you make with your friends because our friends _[00:23:25] our family here so they wanted to make sure we are safe And like Hush[00:23:34] is not even on Facebook You havent logged onto FacebookA:No I knowAnd I just put when some when I have to voice for something like women empowermentQ:SureSo they take it a little seriously okay she actually _[00:23:50] about something we need to hear that kind of thingQ:That is so interesting A:In our case I think we are close to our friends and the bond we have with them because they pushed us They saw the picture and they figured everything else after thatQ:Makes complete sense So Im kind of curious in terms of the waytheres some features of social media or mobile phones that are pretty well documented in the research literature and one of the things Im trying to do is figure out which ones of those are relevant for people who are rescuing you and for people who are rescued in this type of an emergency So one of them was locatability Was it important for people to be able to locate you or not so muchA:Not in our caseQ:Thats what I thoughtA:But in other cases Im sure it mattersQ:Sure rightA:ExactlyQ:And then reach was anybody trying to reach you on your mobile phone while you were trying to get out and evacuate did you have to do any coordinating with peopleA:YesQ:Okay A:Because we had to deal with three people who were driving cars and they were coming from different directions because some of the roads were flooded so one guy could not make it He had to make a U-turn Other guy started and then he was able to reach usQ:And was that were yall actually walking out while you were on your mobile phone trying to contactA:No this is after sitting in the car We wanted to go to some other friends house so nobody knew which roads are flooded and how can we reach there So thats when after getting out we made couple of calls Hey you drop us here and then that guy will come pick us thereQ:Okay Thats great Was it important for you to be available for other people to reach you while you were evacuating or notI didnt understand the questionQ:So was it important for other people to know that you were available they could call you if they needed to as you were trying to leaveNo not reallyA:Except we have _[00:26:00]So the people that we coordinated with we already planned it out So we walk _[00:26:05] Your friend is going to come pickQ:You did that ahead of timeSo we already did that planningQ:Okay A:No but we didn't plan We didnt know which route we were gonna take right So one guy picked us up at the front gate but after that we didn't know can Gesha[00:26:19] come all the way to our place or hes gonna drop us here It was then on the fly Hey you drop us here It was all done on the flyQ:Okay A:Just like we drive wherever we can and then well decide _[00:26:31] After we were on the road it was all on the flyQ:Oh thats interesting Makes complete sense Also your first point on location they already know the location we are in so I would say location is important I say that because I work for a company called Esri and location is everything for us for Esri Q:Okay yeahThats a mapping company Q:Yes Thats you know if you have any pictures that you either posted or took that are related to maps or related to where the reservoirs are in location to you I have becomethe data is very interesting in terms of the important role that maps played And so if you have any of that to share that would be really greatOkay Q:Multimedia you pretty much told me that because you posted that thats what people said What about portability the fact that you told me that you packed things up and took them with you so Im assuming that that was pretty important And you mentioned that it was important for the people who rescued you also rightA:Portability what does that meanQ:Portability means that we can take these things with us and so they can be part of us as we are evacuatingA:I mean the guy who picked us up he was just doing a favor in terms of getting people out He was in his truck thats what he was doing so we don't know too much detail of what he carried I think one thing he carried was that inflatable boat He definitely had that in the pickup truck so the boat has to be portable for somebody to rescue someoneQ:Yes thats exactly trueA:And those were just swimming pool inflatable floaties right thats what Rhia used in the endAmazing rightQ:That is amazingA:Some people used air mattresses Not us but thats what we heard on Facebook people just floating their mattresses and came outQ:Yeah Ive seen some pictures of those What about visibility the fact that its still available to you and visible after everythings over I think whenever you were talking about needing all those pictures for insurance thats probably pretty helpful to have that be persistent I don't know that visible though Visible would mean that you were showing it to other peopleIt is definitely more information is _[00:29:00]Q:Okay A;This is like before hurricane or after hurricaneQ:It can kind of be before during and after because a lot of times what some of the most interesting images Ive seen are what happened before which is where you posted the Look its coming up Thats characteristic And then the Oh gosh its here Its serious The images change whenever people realize they have to evacuate And so some of whats interesting about our mobile devices that we carry with us is the fact that we can see these after the fact that theyre there for us to look back on Sometimes its important for you to be able to edit itOh yeahQ:That was helpfulThat was very helpfulQ:Okay All right And then the last kind of feature is this notion of association Was it ever important for you to be able to mark on social media that you were with a particular group a neighborhood a community a workplace Because some employers sent people out to rescue people or provide some kind of need was that ever importantNo so our friends have a WhatsApp group so we just communicated through that say Hey one of our friends picked us up We are safe kind of thingQ:Got itSo we communicated through WhatsApp yeahA:So it was a friend circleQ:Okay Thats greatA:Not necessarily anything officialQ:Got itAnd of course like we have our family group too so we did a lot of communication through thatQ:Interesting Okay thats greatA:And obviously post-hurricane Nextdoor _[00:30:34] was very helpful to give us update Hey the water has receded this much this much and how accessible it is There were some crime going on_[00:30:45] so Nextdoor of that community after Harvey was very useful in getting updates of whats going onQ:Did anybody from your family go back in to retrieve anything from the houseA:Not until 13 daysQ:Not until the water has residedA:YeahQ:Okay So let me think I think that were probably were pretty close Let me ask you one more question thats kind of related to this and that is what were your perceptions of the rescue efforts that you sawI want to say it was like we were happy to see how like the Houston community came along did whatever they could but we really didn't feel that like we got any kind of support like the government agency or anything That didnt leave a good taste in our mouth and like don't want to talk politics orA:Well actually they didn't give us updateYeah but like people didn't know We had people coming over from San Antonio Dallas leaving what they were doing to come support but we couldnt get that kind of support with the city authorities federal state nothingQ:YesYes so that wasQ:And I think thats a very fair statement to make because across the board since Ive studied a lot of emergencies disasters and crises people always want a lot more information and a lot more updates when theyre in those situations And soand plus there was a lot of complexity I think in the Houston community in terms of yall not necessarily being notified ahead of time and so its gonna be a really complex issue I think that theyre going to be sorting out for yearsRight and also in emergency when they are trying to help out people they need to put more customer faces on the phone and stuff like that I know its a disaster we are already like at rock bottom We don't want on the phone people being rude so trying to find a hotel that FEMA said that Oh you guys have qualified and so much of price gauging going on So much happening We couldnt find a hotel and when we called the FEMA-authorized hotels they said it was gone So then but Ben he called from his phone and I thought like this probablys not right and I called from my phone and I said No Im not calling on behalf of the FEMA Im just gonna pay out of pocket Hes like Yeah the rooms are availableQ:NoWe did notify the FEMA but nothing happenedQ:YeahSo kind of lost that trust with themQ:Trust has become a really big issue with this So did yall ever go to a shelter or did you go straight to a hotelWe went to friends place for one week and then we were fortunate enough that Hushs office supported us to stay in hotel for some timeQ:Thats greatAnd then we moved to this apartment We are one of the fortunate ones to have a decent financial background to be able to support us even though if we didn't get much you know we both have good jobs and been working for 15-20 years so we are fortunate Not too many people were fortunate And we pay high property taxes We pay a lot of taxes and we needed help We didn't get that kind of supportQ:Yeah So your company helpedA:Yes for one month hotelQ:Okay And I heard a fair number of companies did a lot for their employeesA:Yes That is correctQ:Thats great So in addition to hotel did they do anything elseA:Yeah I mean they gave me a lot of freedom Hey don't have to rush to come back to work Take care of your house first and well not cut your pay things like thatQ:Thats goodA:Yeah so I had both emotional and hotel support from them Theyre fairly nice yesQ:That does sound amazing So the last kind of question that I like is is there anything that I havent asked you about that you think might be helpful since you understand what were trying to capture And then obviously Ill give you each a card I gave her one but let me give you one too because if you can send me over some images I actually have a research assistant back in Austin and shes able to pull everything down for me and then we can kind of start to pull it together to create a picture of what your rescue looked likeSureQ:But anything else that might be related Can I ask you a quick question did you havedo you use a phone or any social media with your friendsNoQ:You dont okay Youre protectedYesQ:Thats actually very good to hear because I have some people your age that thats not the case so… YeahA:But yeah main thing I think I felt  is communication from the city was very poor because imagine if Im stuck in the house 7:00 pm power is gone and 2:00 am 4 of waves comes in my house rightQ:I just cant imagineA:Especially if Im in a one-story house I would have to climb the table and theres no other option And going into attic is not recommended anywayQ:Not its notA:So imagine if Im a senior citizen on a wheelchair and 4 of wave is suddenly released without information I think thats where a lot of residents in our community are mad really madQ:I bet Yeah No it makes senseA:Luckily we left a day early otherwise we would be doing the same I mean a lot of houses are not two-story houses so Im sure they must have climbed tables and chairs Otherwise because our whole house is a swimming pool right 4 So thats my I think biggest regret from the communication point of view but I think as she said friends helping friends community helping that was the greatest scene out of this hurricane People actually came together very goodYeah it doesnt matter how many friends you have on the social media The connection that you make one-on-one it outlaws everything Yeah like I don't have too many friends on Facebook but I was disappointed because one or two people that I know they didn't get any response and they have like a really big social media presence Not like celebrities but big presence like 500-600 person I probably have _[00:37:46] friendsQ:And they did not get a responseThey did not get a response She was like really upset about it And her husband was out of town and she was stuck with two kidsQ:Oh noYeah I was like Oh…Q:Part of me wonders did she post a pictureI hate to say this butof the kidsNo she didn't post a picture of the kids She lives in a similar pretty close by where we live and not of kids She did postshe said she called 9-1-1 They asked her like theyre going to send rescue like by morning so they told her go to the second floor They made sure that she has a second floor She said she was on like the low priority list right now And I hadnobody took that step to come and help her out from friends _[00:38:48] because I kind of felt sad for her _[00:38:50]Q:Yeah that is sadYeahQ:That gives me a lot to think about because we have a lot of research literature that talks about the fact that you can have a ton of friends on social media that arent really friends and it sounds like thats the case And I love your message that its really those connections you make in person that make all the difference in the world that you have to have had those relationships before this happensYeah hands down for usQ:YeahThe people we made connections is who pulled us out of way YeahQ:Amazing Okay Well thank you so much I really appreciate it Ill turn this offEND OF RECORDING [00:39:32]IleeneEnergyA:I understandQ:Thank you I appreciate that The other thing is as were talking through things a lot of times people do pull up pictures and talk from the picture and that can be a really great kind of way to talk through some of the questionsA:Ill get my computer out tooQ:So please feel free to get that out And then if you send me anything I actually have a dedicated project phone and the phone number is that and the emails thatA:And youre giving this to meQ:And it goes straight to that so Ill give that to you now but and if were talking and youre like Oh let me screenshot that and send it to you you can send it to that phoneA:Right Let me just mute that Thats my ringcomQ:Yeah How does that workA:Well you set up motion sensitive areas and then if anything triggers it then itll give you an alert And I have mine really sensitive so it will record everything just in case I need something Because periodically things happen and you never knowQ:Thats so interestingA:YeahQ:I havent played with that or seen it I don't guessA:Well its really cool You canIll show you Ive got actually three of their devices and so you can bring up the video and see whats going on around your houseQ:Oh sureA:So its really neatQ:Its called ringcomA:Mm-hmm Its really cool Its kind of new technology Like heres my back door Something must have just triggered that some motionQ:WowA:And especially with Hurricane Harvey and everything you know theres been a lot of crime and so its nice to be able to pull this up Q:Because we have cameras but we don't have it set up on an app I don't think Actually my husband might who knowsA:See Ive got front door I got cameras through ADT and I kind of like technology and stuff Here well that was the back door Heres the front door So you have live views and event history so you can pull up things that are recorded to the cloudQ:WowA:So I have likeI have cameras and then I have these cameras So thats the front door and then I have something at the corner of my houseQ:Now was your house floodedA:It was not The water gotI can show you on the app Id say block block and a half two blocks at the closest And I can give you more details We have a ditch running behind our home that we were concerned might flood In fact Ill show you a little bit here And I will bring you up some apps Its black and white now because of the darkness I live on the corner and actually this picture will be interesting Ill keep it live This will multi-task between cameras Youre doing social media or next door per seQ:Yes anything that people posted that gives us an indication of what a real call for help looks like or a real rescueA:Oh okayQ:Thats really kind of the focus is how were people rescued how did people let the word out what happened before they even realized they needed to be rescued and to try to get that kind of unfolding picture of a rescueA:And have you talked to quite a few peopleQ:You know I have Were at about Im a little over 30 people nowA:Thats goodQ:And beyond just your neighborhood However your neighborhood is the first one that Ive really seen that people used the Nextdoor mapping and all the different colorsA:YesQ:That is pretty impressive I don't see many neighborhoods that are that organized A:Well good and I think that really played a big part And so theres probably some things that we could share that might possibly be outside your realm of research or maybe youre interested This is myyou may have seen this before Have you seen these maps on Nextdoor before My little dots when you gothey disappeared but this is my neighborhood This is the Fleetwood neighborhood and were actually made up of four neighborhoods within one larger one Fleetwood the greater is mostwell let me carve out the small areas The green dot is my home and I live just in this little northwest corner okay Theres a little neighborhood around this lake here thats discreet And then south of Memorial kind of in this corner here this is called Fleetwood West The rest of this is Fleetwood and my neighborhood was not affected at all and actually the water kind of ran from about here to around hereQ:Yeah and then everybody down here was rightA:Yes And people over in the east corner this portion here they were affected really bad The water when I said Ill try toI have to close it and then Ill bring up the level dots The water got up to the curb to about a block block and a half from me And Ill try to show that clearly Q:The other thing Im noticing is the role that maps played and yall sharing like elevation and all this kind of stuff thats been very eye-opening I didnt really realize how much maps communicatedA:Yes and that really came into play I think for the most part after the flooding during and after the flooding Because Ive now found that I escaped the flooding by being 7 higherQ:Wow Yeah I can see that thats the caseA:So let me bring up the map again with… Okay So theres my house and if I go to small all those dots disappear Okay The ones that are in green are on Nextdoor The ones in yellow had been invited and some people were on Nextdoor and now theyre no longer there They sold their homes But this is mynot that it matterslittle neighborhood just these nine homes here nine homes here and these five This is what we call Fleetwood VillageQ:Oh interestingA:And then from here on and then on around is Fleetwood And the waterokay this is Memorial here The waterlets see heres my street Heres a street Okay The water camethis is aits marked as a street but this is really an alley The water came up to the curb to this alley and then back over Memorial it was just totally coming over And then what I was trying to show you with the picture out the front of my door there was a gate over hereQ:Yes Ive seen that gateA:And it wasyou probablythe gate became very importantQ:YesA:You may have heard That was the only entrance in and out that people could walk in and out for a long time And so it was sort of like refugee central people carrying out their suitcases and then coming back in And a lot of socialization going on because of all thisQ:Because of the gate wowA:Yeah And we had a ditch right here andas you know like with relationships and communications things are not always perfect And sometimes theres neighborhood politics and conflictQ:Absolutely yeahA:And so weve had good bad and the ugly with our neighborhoods And before the stormwell my neighborhood is the only one that doesnt have an HOAQ:Oh it doesntA:It doesnt and because of that theres been resentments for like 30-35 years long-standingQ:WowA:That social media has helped to start to erase but then human nature being as it is it will rise againQ:Of courseA:So anyway beforewell all this to say even though our neighborhood is very nice people have tended for 30 years to consider us like skid row or tobacco row or the other side of the tracksQ:Because you dont have an HOAA:Yes and becauseQ:May I take just a picture of that to remind me where that gate is that youre talking aboutA:Yes you sure can And its this street hereQ:Okay I thinkyeah I have driven past that because people have talked about it And so I was curious about what it looked likeA:Now if you use that map in your book or anything it does have a star for my home so I don't know if you mightQ:Oh don't worry thatI cant see that that would bewe could take that offA:Blur it out or something possibly you know becauseQ:Thats not a problemA:Okay But its interesting because we had this drainage ditch and because we don't have an HOA you know we don't contribute money So a few of us try to take care of common areas but over the years you know Ive only been there for 7  years but so sometimesthese people have nice manicured little ditch areas and ours looks more like Buffalo BayouQ:Ive heard about thatA:About the ditchQ:And theres another neighborhood right over here rightA:Barkers Landing right up north uh-huhQ:Yeah andA:In fact Ill come up This is Barkers Landing Yeah werewe connect through Nextdoor to between 8000 and 9000 people And it was a very very powerful tool before during and after And even now during the recovery So this is Barkers Landing and they were flooded as well And Marie Wood Chase Memorial Thicket just all kinds of things And heresthis is Buffalo Bayou the green Q:And yall just kind of self-organized as your group to go out there and periodically work on your ditchA:We do and they complain sometimes and as we saw the storm coming you know they thinksometimes peopleand weve worked through this you know weve had conflict and then weve talked and were for the most part things are good now you know the crisis brings people togetherQ:It does yeahA:But I know when the storm was coming and they were complaining about you know even before Youre gonna flood your homes and all this Well I didnt want to be contributing None of us wanted to be contributing to flooding anyone else our neighbors Like Barkers Landing up here they were concerned that it would back up and affect them So I think four of us from my neighborhood from our 23 homes 4 of us got out there and 1 person from Fleetwood and 1 person from Barkers Landing Friday when Hurricane Harvey was hitting Corpus and we cleaned those areas out And Im so glad I don't know if we would have had problems but we did not flood And but just for my conscience Im glad that no one could say we flooded because you didn't take care of stuff upstream you knowSo anyway so thats kind of the ditch and refugee centralQ:Thats so interesting the kind of implications that invisible neighborhood boundaries have because I drove through that area after the first couple of people that I spoke to and you cant tell that thats a different areaA:No not at all Now the reasonjust brief history of the politics and you might have heard some of itoriginally that gate and the brick wall thats there was totallyit was open and the brick wall was behind my house along the alley between our twolet me close this againQ:Two neighborhoodsA:Yes And because once uponit was originally founded by the same builder Kickerillo[00:11:59] but one of my neighbors has connections Her husband was a builder and they were kind of in partnership with the guy back in the 70s when this was being built But there were five builders and I think there was conflict that eventually arose in them then and so what theyour area they had intended on originally being like tennis courts or something and then things changed And then they put in patio homes so most of the homes are smaller Mines been enlarged so mines as big as anyone elses but so they were smaller homes And so in the beginning you know some of those homes are quite largeQ:YeahA:And so theywhat we hear is they sort of look down their noses at us And we wanted to be a part of them and they didn't want us to be a partQ:Of courseA:And so some of our original neighbors they got offended and so they went on for many many years And then when their people started getting onfalling on difficult financial times and they could have used our money for fees they wanted us and our people would say Well heck you snubbed us in the beginning and we got along just fine without you so heck no And so theres beensome of the old-timers there is some old resentments and sometimes that gets passed on subconsciously even to new people So thats some of the historyQ:Thats interesting yeahA:But a little more on okay so try to bring the map up again It used to be a brick wall behind and so there was no connection between our neighborhoods And then these people in Fleetwood Proper wanted their kids to be able to walk to school Theres an elementary school here So whats weird is because one ofmy neighbor right here theyre some original owners They got up and their husband went to work and the wall was there and they came home and the wall had been moved And these people without checking with us or getting our approval they moved the wall so that no longer could people drive in And people were like concerned that their teenage kids were gonna come home that night and not notice and drive into the wall But they blocked off that street and put in a gate And then now the only way we can get here is to go in through their entrance And so again just reasons why theres been conflict is then over the years theres been conflict at Oh youre using our entrance and youre not paying for our security We have security and for a while they were paying for our trash pickup and we werent contributing So its complicated you know money and stuff And none of that neighborhood floodedQ:NoA:And some of old-time neighbors they were likewell what can you say A little bit of irony you know But even so several of us still did reach out and _[00:15:06] and everything Q:And it looks like a lot of you are on Nextdoor tooA:We are yeah And I actually used to beI use Nextdoor quite a bit I used to be one of the leads and there ended up being some conflict and so Im no longer a lead but I really you know I see the strength and the beauty in here Theres good bad and ugly that comes with it So thats a little history in the maps and all thatQ:So were you stuck in your neighborhoodA:Well yes and that was interesting Let me try to reconstruct the timeline You know Hurricane Harvey hit Corpus on Friday but it started doing damage to us in the wee hours in the morning after midnight on Sunday night Monday morning And then they continued to release water I have to backtrack I think it was Tuesday afternoon probably when we got cut off and so of course people are out You know most people are usually inside quite a bit We walk or you know we go through seasons where people are inside and out and socializing more but for the most part in modern society at least a lot of neighborhoods youre inside quite a bit But when crisis happens people get out of that and start you know you communicate here but you also communicate face-to-face And so people where theres conflict and you havent been talking you know theyre out and theyre talking And its quite interesting And so were out visiting and people are walking by and theyre suggesting theyre saying The water is rising near the entrance What were doing and what yall should do is take your cars and get out of here And youve probably seen it This is Addicks Howell Highway 6 is here This is Addicks Howell There are some small businesses with small multi-layer parking lots So many of us we took our cars and parked them over here on like the second and third floor So then we could you know there was a time on Monday actually when Highway I-10 and everything and Highway 6 for a long time they were impassable and so we were stuck But as it began to subside and the rest of the city you know we were still flooded down in here We could walk in and out of the gate and get about as need be even though parts were still cut off and a lot of people would have to take routes way far around to get to where they needed to goQ:But yall could still walk in and out of that gate even when you couldnt get in and out of MemorialA:Exactly Q:InterestingA:And thats what a number of people did And unfortunately you know many of the people that flooded over early Monday morning their cars were flooded So we could get in and out and everythingQ:Wow and so the power went off also right they cut the powerA:Yes and thats what really was a blessing about my neighborhood These 18 homes we did not lose powerQ:Oh my goshA:These five did and I think there was one or two thats on the same grid And on the south side of Memorial theres a little bit in Fleetwood West thats on the same grid that most of those were flooded so thatso becauseokay youve met SharonQ:YeahA:Did you meethow did you get in touch with Sharon was it because of the mayor I saw that they had honored her andQ:She actually reached out to me A:Did sheQ:Come to find out when she was honored the Houston Chronicle had quoted me because I had just gotten this grantA:Very goodQ:And then she reached out to me and said Hey if youre interested I think our neighborhood has an interesting story to tell for research And so I got in touch with her from that and then she put the post out on Nextdoor I think it was And so Ive gotten this eclectic interesting mix of people that have said that they would participate and so its been very interestingA:Do you know where Sharon lives in relation to meQ:Shes pretty close to you rightA:Yes she is She lives rightlets see this is the street This is the alley She lives right here I don't know why it has partially redQ:Oh interesting okay And so she ran a generator becauseA:Her husband is in construction and boats and all kinds of stuffQ:She said they had a generator and people were coming over to plug in because they had all lost powerA:Well I didnt know that because she was coming to my home to charge her cell phoneQ:Oh thats funny Maybe they were using hereverybody wasshe said her generator eventually diedA:Did it Yeah Or maybe she got it after the initial thingQ:InterestingA:Yeah But yeah Yeah I have lots of stories I can tell you more as it goes onQ:How was it being in the neighborhood and having a lot of people have to be rescued around you How did you see that happen and unfoldA:Right Well again because Im pretty prolific writer and Im on Nextdoor quite a bit Ive backed off a little bit and Im pretty organizational and everything And Ive done big neighborhood projects but when this came along Sharon and her husband they kind of rose to the forefront and they had skills and resources And so I took more of a supporting role but even so I am you know whatever You know Im pretty organizational and pretty active So kind of my role wasor how it played out is that because I had power and Im an extreme night owl anyway and Im a news junky and very organizational so Im up all night long and Im watching news and Im communicating and people are communicating with me And like people are like one lady I think they were overseas and theyre finding out about this and then theyre in New York and then theyre communicating with me And people are talking about their concerns about their homes and so Im now walking the neighborhoods at two oclock in the morning and Im seeing where the water levels Im going and looking at the ditch and Highway 6Q:Did you take pictures of that and share that back with people in any wayA:I did some and Ill show you But I know what I think that you want and I wish I had but I chose not to take the pictures is you know I guess because II was in the middle of like helping with some of the stuff and I don't know I just didn't do it for privacy or whateverQ:Of course The pre stuff and the fact that you shared that back with people who werent local thats actually really helpful Because lots of people who have these picture of people who are on boats and rescues and all that kind of stuff but what a lot of the context around how it happened and how it unfolded is also very I think helpfulA:Right And Im not sure when I started taking pictures Actually okay well Ill tell you a little bit more Okay So what happened youre asking how you know with all this stuff going on around me Okay So Im up all night long watching Jeff Limner[00:23:11] and the Army Corps of Engineers and they had said Were gonna have a news conference at two oclock in the morning So Im watching it and theyre saying Oh well we actually started releasing the water at midnight you know and soand as you know where we are you know that were right up here is the Addicks Reservoir and here is the Barkers Landing So were about as close as you can get I mean theres several neighborhoods but were right there And Im right on the edge you knowQ:You areA:And so whats interesting is that so many of the peopleand many of the people that you talked to probably did not have power and so they werent able to watch those newscasts Ive heard some people they went into their cars and listened on the radio But I was able to watch it and glean body language and things of that nature So I knew that things were flooding I knew things were happening and I think I went to bed Monday morning somewhere between I think it was maybe 7:30 in the morning sometime between 5:30 and 7:30 in the morning And my husband is exactly opposite of me goes to bed early and gets up earlySo I went to bed and I was gonna wake up and see what he wanted to do because we usually make decisions jointly And one of my neighbors she actually lives over here she went around knocking on doors and ringing doorbells about 9:30 and so she woke me up And probably a little earlier than I would have woken up on my own and she reported that things are flooding theyre rescuing blah blah blah And so my husband answered the door and talked with her I heard her and so that got me up and we discussed and decided what we wanted to do okay Well I went ahead and you know we didn't get out there I don't think until about 11:30 We ate got cleaned up a little bit got dressed for the weather because it was raining And I pulled out my Niagara Falls rain slicker and showed up in boots I think my husband drove us down and hes you know I don't know Im kind of more of an out there person So I got out He drove us to Crossroads and Memorial which is right hereQ:As you come in yeahA:Okay And its all flooding and theres boats over there and pickups Still the level is not high enough so if you had a high water vehicle theres some that are able to get in and out But so we showed up over there about 11:30 and I see Sharon right off I don't think I had seenprobably I don't know if I had checked on Nextdoor I don't know if she had said anything on Nextdoor at that point but I know her and I could tell that she was taking charge And so I connected with her pretty quickly and I think she was driving her pickup up Crossroads And there were some people in there and there was a boat with an elderlya 90-something year old all stretched out And so you know shes a psychologist Im a counselor a clinical counselor by background and so anyway we just sort of connected and she put me in contact with this family because they were distressed Theyre not on Nextdoor Theyre some original owners The wife was 89 The man was in his 90s Hes 92-94 Im not sure Disabled And they had a 60-some odd year old son living with them And they hadfrom multi-culturalthey had an African-American caretaker So we havethats the beauty of our neighborhood in the Energy coordinator is that we have people from all over the globe We have from Asia India all over So multi-ethnic but anyway so these four people I got connected with and the wife was 89 and shes all stressed out And I think Sharon was trying to get her to do something or go someplace or I don't know and she wasnt cooperating So I went over and talked with her and Sharon was you know of course very busy and didn't really have time to maybe spend a lot of one-on-one So I went over there and I was able to connect with her and I said Would you like to come to my home And she agreed and so all four of them ended up coming to my home And at first I was thinking well its just gonna be for a few hours and theyre gonna call and somebody will come rescue them Well no they come in and theyre all wet They have their little refugee bag of a little bit of stuff And two walkers and a wheelchair and theyre there for 24 hours And so theyre stripping off their clothes in our living area and were holding up sheets so they can have some privacy and trying to find clothes of ours that would fit them that were dry and then start doing their laundry And just going through all the caretaking there you know They forgot some meds so did we have some meds that would work you know and then helping to calm them and encourage them and get in touch with family figure out what theyre gonna do And our guest bedrooms are upstairs I was thinking they would be up there and then I realized oh look they don't go upstairs Q:Exactly Oh thats so trueA:So ended up changing sheets and they have our bedroom and bathroom And then two guest areas upstairs and my husband and I moved to one their son goes to one Their caretaker needs to be close to them during the night and so we make her a comfortable bed on the couch And so we make food and have wine and celebrate and get to know some new friendsQ:Wow And they were able to contact family to come get themA:Right They had a son and I don't remember now if he tried to come get them Monday and couldnt Probably so But on Tuesday he was able to come and the caretaker her son was able to come And so we met everybody and they rescued them probably early afternoon and that was about the time we were hearing we needed to be moving our cars out And so we went out the Crossroads area Some cars were already starting to be flooded out but we were able to get out And then before too long its either maybe that day or the next day I don't know then the water is actually totally flowing to South going over Memorial and it had already been filling up on our side but its actually covering you know its that level Q:Yeah A:So then after that experience that took a lot of energy out of us because youre really caring for people like that And webecause this happened so quickly you know the people who were flooded we didn't have any notice of course which is a big issue And most people were not able to move things to higher ground Because we took people in so quickly we didn't have the opportunity to do that either Q:You didn't prep yeahA:And so as they left we were trying to get our home back in order catch our breath but also connect with weather reports and what the officials are saying Do we need to move things off of our ground floor do we need to evacuate And it was sort of like a rollercoaster yes we do no we don't yes we do And it ended up where we didn't And Ill back up a little bit and then if Im taking up too much of your time and saying too muchQ:No this is greatA:Okay What is interesting for us is that you know the eclipse was the week before I don't know if anybody brought thatQ:Yeah Nobodys brought that up but I do remember thatA:Okay And we decided at the last minute so the last two weeks to go up to Idaho to go see it So the eclipse was on Monday and we went up on Saturday We were flying home on Wednesday and Im forgetting I think we were hearing about Hurricane Harvey on Tuesday but for sure on Wednesday we were hearing about it And in factit was so funnywith our location and not being close to the Gulf we really werent too concerned even though what is it Hurricane Ike or pervious hurricaneswe were in Ohio for 20 years so we missed that except how it hit up there We knew it could affect out area but we werent too concerned And there were people behind us on the airplane that lived closer to the Gulf They were new to the area and we were looking up the evacuation area and saying Oh yeah youre you know not trying to scare them but in Evacuation Zone 1 or whatever and so when you get there you should probably touch base and see what needs to be done And so really not thinking we had much to be concerned about But even so we heard it was coming our way so on Thursday and Friday we did prepare our outside And so we got plants and patio furniture we did what we could So that was prepared but we never didwere able to do anythinginside And we never ended up doing it So anyway after our guests left and our new friends leftand as I think I said they were elderly and they were not on Nextdoor but their neighbor I ended up maybe a younger neighbor was and I ended up talking to her on the phone and she told me about them And so social media came into play And I could see on here where they lived and all this kind of stuff So these maps are interesting and important But then took some time to kind of regroup and decompress and rest and so I guess you know again I probably was walking the streets at night and staying up all night and reporting and doing things online But I didnt go out to do anything physically until Friday and that is when I believe when the rescuesI believe that was a big day for rescues Friday and Saturday I don't know that it was going on before that at least maybe not such organized way Sharon or others could tell you more But I showed up again being a night owl I showed up around noon And it was kind of good because one of the guys that actually helped clean our ditch that lives in Barkers Landing I don't know if you might have even interviewed him he was a big part in helping And as I showed up he was saying things like You know wow I was wondering if we were just gonna get so exhausted helping people And I cant quote sort of that sentiment and my sense wasand I think what I said to him wasand I cant quote it but it was like You know we do what were able and we sort of take care of ourselves and it comes in waves Like I did some work and then I rested and refreshed myself And then I was ready to come back in and then some other people were ready to go restSo this is all communicating online Sharon is putting out here whats going on and so we show up I think on Sundaywas it that Sunday or the following SundayMedias gonna be here and so some of us showed up I mean media was there all the time but thats probably maybe a about a week later when that media call went out was sort of when our concerns about not being notified began to be voiced to the media and we were able to express that So anyway on Friday I think I was there and other people were there too and I was there I think from around you know maybe noonish until 7:00 or so at night And what I did is I kind of took over again being kind of an organizing type person Sharon her husband was running the boats and many many other people were doing the boats And they were coming from all over And so what we were doing is theres a table and we had people signing in and out And it was not a perfect operation but webecause I think my _[00:36:36] genes kind of run in that area I think I tightened it up a little bit It got a little more organized Not perfect but… But we tried to keep track of who was going in and who came out because you may have heard some people eventually were stuck or got left out there Q:Yeah rightA:Or left in there Not overnight but then their callif they had phones theyre calling or theyre waving boats down Hey weve been here for a few hours Whos gonna come back and get us And it is interesting because again because of social media and because our neighborhood is so organized and we use that very much personally I think were probably this 8000 or 9000 my sense is that the best I can tell that I think were the most organized Maybe Im wrong but I think we play a very key role And so because of that we formed relationships online as well as physically with people in Barkers Landing _[00:37:46] North Fleet Memorial Thicket to the Southeast and others And so when we were at Memorial and Crossroads and its like command central Boats are going out here Theyre also going out to other neighborhoods and therell be people from other neighborhoods And Ill meet them or whatever and Im sure it didn't just happen with me but it happened with me And theyll go Oh so youre Delane You know because they knew me from Nextdoor Q:Because they had seen you onlineA:YeahQ:Thats so neatA:And even one of my neighbors that I knew a little bit she started crying a little bit when she saw me And then she came to my home latera few weeks laterand said the same thing that she found it very comforting People that you had began to form relationships with online then when you connect with them in person even though youve never known them before you have a level of relationship and trust and comfort And so it was a blessing It was fun It was tragic and there was good things in the middle of itSo we were kind of like command central Maybe Sharon and others have told you There were people going south Lots of boats going south And youve probably heard stories the currents were so strong they were spinning boats aroundQ:I did hear that And Im still trying to figure out why the currents were so strong was it through the narrow parts of the neighborhoodA:No I think its because it was by the Bayou Lets try to get down thereQ:Oh okayA:All right so herelet me just make it smaller and make the homes disappearQ:Sure thats fineA:So here is the Bayou And actually if we go over here you can see the Bayou And even where is this Theres another areaoh well where water comes in from the north Im trying to find it Okay So theres Highway 6 where we live Its probably just a little small Here it is Okay It looks small but this is Terry Hershey Park and there is water running through here And so water from Addicks that was being released is coming down through here and then water from Barkers Reservoir is coming from hereQ:Oh wowA:And so its coming here So its right in this area Okay Heres like I think the spillway that was being releasedQ:In that cornerA:Yes And its actually one of my neighbors in Fleetwood Village that was on one of the first boats with Sharons husband And it was at the end of Ivy Wall Drive and this is Ivy Wall And it just the current was so strong and I think it wasI was hearing if you werent careful with the boats it would knock you into the brick mailboxes and everything But it was spinning around there Q:So it just had to do with the combination of the bodies of waterA:Yes and the location and just the swiftness and everything So anyway I was talking about command central being like right here Memorial and Crossroads And what was interesting is that it wasntwe werent just doing our neighborhood We were sending boats to Memorial Thicket and I think to Barkers Landing and even before the mayor put the kibosh on things there were boats that were going all the way down to Eldridge and then this area because…Q:Let medo you mind let me take a picture of the bigbecause what I hadnt realized is that the Bayou is down there on the bottom and they could boat the Bayou right and that was reliableA:No I don't think they were boatQ:They couldntA:No they were boating the streets the roads Q:I knew they were boating the streetsA:Yeah No don'tit probably was way tooQ:ReallyA:I heard it was like 20 down at the BayouQ:Golly thats amazingA:Yeah and this is Briar hills I don't know if youve talked to people on the south sideQ:I haventA:But they have like berms high bermsQ:ReallyA:If you want to you shouldwell I don't know if its even open now but you should walk or bike or go down along the Bayou and see Q:Ill do thatA:But they were flooded down here too but they had higher berms But anyway so again I just found it interesting that it was like command central that we were sending boats far away and we were keeping track of multiple neighborhoods Q:Well wasnt it these two neighborhoods right in this area where like 100% everything was underwater MaryA:Marywood Chase and Memorial Thicket yes Ive heard because Im part of what they call Super NeighborhoodsQ:Yes Ive heard of that nowA:Im part of that and I met some people recently theyre off to the east I think there was more flooding to the east when they did some more releases and I think some of those neighborhoods were flooded 100% they were telling me as well But up to this point I had just heard of Memorial Thicket and I assume Marywood Chase And most of ours was I would guessI guess Id been guessing maybe about 60 70 80% of our homesQ:In yalls yeah I think thats what I heard A:Seventy plus I would think that thats a good averageQ:And so the combination of the reservoirs and the fact youre right there on the Bayous the big one A:Yes because thats where the water goes when they release the water This is the main reservoir and in fact Jeff Lindner[00:43:50] I went and heard He spoke at our Super Neighborhood a few weeks ago and I think he said this is like one of the few remaining natural watersheds that are left so its a main one And thats why I and especially people who were flooded you know were setting there towe know where we are our proximity and theyre giving warnings but theyre not giving specific warningsQ:Yes I heard A:Yeah and I just know Im close Im close to this ditch Im close to all this and were close to the Bayou And so Im watching and Im listening and Im reading between the lines And that was very disappointingQ:Yeah And yall havent flooded beforeA:Me or whoQ:Within your neighborhood you only have a certain area that flooded for the Tax Day Floods I think is that rightA:Correct Yeah weve had the Memorial Day floods and Tax Day floods So pockets have had a little bit of flooding but no nothing like this Its been more like drainage systems that have been backed up failing infrastructure or people not keeping their drains clear and like the ditch and all that kind of stuff Q:Which is why yall prioritized that and did a community led effort to get those things fixed ahead of timeA:Right and why again through Nextdoor because of relationships why one person from Fleetwood and one person from Barkers Landing that they had enough relationships with us that they were willing to pitch in and helpQ:WowA:Because it affected them as well you knowQ:Of courseA:And they knew that we had very few people that were willing to get out there and do this as well Q:Yeah And the other thing thats so interesting to me is that water doesnt care that theres these artificial boundaries that weve set up with neighborhoodsA:Right Q:Mother Nature is gonna do whatit doesnt arbitrarily stop because youre in a different neighborhood yet we have set up these systems that are sowe created these artificial boundaries and Im becoming more and more interested in how these boundaries contribute And sometimes people are able to cross the boundaries and it sounds like some of the social media has connected people across the boundariesA:ExactlyQ:In some positive waysA:Exactly definitely And Ill say this I don't know if you say anything like this is your research I want you to be careful I don't know maybe we can discuss it if you think it would fit or whatever but what Ilike youre sayingwell crisis and things they bring people together and so wethere has been the divide between the neighborhoods and theres been times where that started to get better and then it would flare up again And it actually had flared up and there actually was some conflict that was occurring you know that hadNextdoor was a part of it and it would surface on NextdoorAnd it was interesting because there had been people that were not willing to try to resolve the conflict before and then after the crisis occurred they were more open to resolving that And so some conflict that was in place before got resolvedQ:And we see that in the research literature and I also see people who left Nextdoor years ago because they were like This is just a place for people to whine and complain but then you also see really useful uses of these same platforms So theyre not perfect and were not gonna make them perfect Its more figuring out when they work when they can be helpful and whats kind of the magic And I don't know let me ask you your perception especially since you said you were organizing out there keeping track of who was going in and out That actually seems like it might be a pretty good function if you have a map of the neighborhood and you can literally mark and keep track of whos in and whos outA:RightQ:That actually might be a great use of this type of a toolA:And probably some people did that Actually I had my phone in my raincoat pocket Monday when I went and rescued people and I thought itd be safe but it was raining and it got wet and it got destroyedQ:Okay I keep hearing this tooA:Do youQ:Yes A:And so Apple actually was very gracious and they gave me a new one but it was probably a week or two before I finally had time to go And I was using actually my husbands and stuff so I probably had his phone with me when I was out there organizing but I don't know We had people that knew the neighborhood so well that you know and again this isa lot of this cohesiveness I believe has come together because of NextdoorQ:YeahA:Ive only been a part of it for Im gonna say three years and I think its been up therebecause they ostracized our little group and it took a year for them to finally decide to allow us inQ:WowA:But it had been I think there for six or seven years so I thinkpersonally I mean Im sure there were groups beforehand and there was some cohesiveness but I just really think that this really has brought a lot of cohesiveness And Im kind of a cheerleader even though Ive suffered some of the slings and arrows that have come about with social media and the negative things I don't like it because Im part of the Super Neighborhood meeting A lot of times its sort of like cool or has been cool to say Im not _[00:50:04] today or yesterday Im not on Facebook or Im not on Nextdoor or whatever Or politicians Oh I hate Nextdoor or whatever And I actually confronted one of our politicians this last December that I actually like and I said Well I think thats like saying you dont like the office water cooler because this is how we communicate these days And I saidwe were talking about the other side of the political fences I was saying they had kind of embraced it and I had said Why would you want to just abandon it to the other side I think all sides should embrace it And theres always gonna be the positive and the negative and you just have to work through it you knowQ:There isA:Its a lot of powerQ:Yeah and so it sounds like some of your conversations early on when you were walking the neighborhood at night giving people updates was some of that happening through Facebook alsoA:Actually not a lot because most of my Facebook contacts are more distant relatives or remote maybe Ohio And I was so busy with this that I pretty much neglected Facebook And maybe once or twice I would put maybe a news clip or something up there or to show them but my life has really changed to probably so many even though I was not flooded After going off on the eclipse and coming back and this thing hitting immediately you know it radically changes your lifeQ:Yeah it doesA:And so theres a lot of things that Ive pulled back from that I was more a part ofQ:Theres things youve pulled back from that you were a part of beforeA:Right Well I used to be just a real news junkie and everything and now I felt like I was living the news and still am and like in the middle of itQ:So trueA:And so I just Ive kind of unhooked a lot from that And soand just some other things you know I just kind of you know weveand even though we werent flooded you know personal things have happened in our life Loss of jobs deaths of family members so theres just been lots that had happened and its like you know the normal center of normal has shifted Q:It hasA:Its not what it was beforeQ:So that is very helpful to get that perception and that perspective thatand it is interesting because even doing this research has changed some of my practices already And I think it will change long-term A lot of kind of the decisions that Ive made in terms of use of social media I told my husband he can bring the generator home now which he was very happy about You know lots of interesting things and it makes you rethink And then the other thing I don't think I told you at the beginning is when I was in the third grade we lived on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River North Central Texas and not on a flood plain And we got a call that they were letting water out down the river and we were probably gonna be flooded A:But you got a call but stillQ:We did get a call but we were like Its never flooded before what is wrong with these people Its not even raining here Several days later as the waters coming over the road people start showing up at my house and moving the kids out and one or two things and then its in our house And so we had 5  feet of water in our house for 2  weeks A:So similarQ:So similar and so when I was watching this unfold it was like theyre going through the same thing I did and my family did And I think my parents only paid off the second mortgage on the housebecause they essentially lost everything the first timeabout five years ago So its a lifetime that it affects a family and a community And so thats the other thing that is so interesting to me is how the community is affect And even the homes not flooded those residents are affectedA:Yeah we are because thats where our connections are to one degree or another Q:Thats rightA:Or you want to help you know even if you dont know them or if you know them a little bit you become more connectedQ:So with your background with you specifically mentioning that you have a counseling background Im curious do you think that some people feel guilt if their house was not hit when a lot of other people in their neighborhood wasA:They might and you hear that in the media People talk about it and actually on Nextdoor we had to battle that I don't know if you heard about thatQ:Did you Uh uhA:In person and on Nextdoor I personally got attacked and some other people got attacked too by people who were angry and flooded And I tried to be somewhat careful in the things that I said especially afterwell I don't know tried to be careful but stumbling into something in person that day that Sunday Maybe it was a week or two weeks after the flooding Maybe it was just a week just talking about what I had learned by watching the authorities and what they said and talking about how Well this is why they said they had to make that decision and peoplethis one man in particular in our neighborhood that I hadnt known before was very angry and really just attacked me for being rational reallyQ:Of course thats gonna happenA:And I saw some other people really kind of take that stance on Nextdoor and be viciously attacked And so I kind of realized that you just sort of let them go through the grieving process Theyre angry and theyre hurt and I said a little bit and I have been attacked but I don't know maybe its because of my background and because of what Ive worked through that Im not taking on that guiltQ:Yes that could beA:And I have just not trying to be defensive but at times I have said what people who have werent flooded have been able to do to help others and that we were grateful to do that and just sort of leave it out there Q:I think thats a good way to do that And youre right youre probably right your background has probably helped you in a lot of ways in terms of coping and even helping others copeA:Right and trying not to take on things that really arent yours to take onQ:AbsolutelyA:So I think yeah it helps And working through that just having the studies doesnt you know you have to kind of live through it like your experience has given you a lot more insight into what youre studying now than just being a professor in communicationQ:Absolutely and you know when I had to work through it the first few times I came down to Houston I literally cried all the way back to Austin and I was like Okay Kerry theres only so much you can do and what you can do is you can help by better understanding the practices that worked and better getting a handle around how were people rescued Because in reality for the type of disaster that we had happen in this area to have lost as few people a lot happened right I mean losing anyone is horrible but in years past the numbers would have been a lot higherA:Major yeah Yeah Im aware of two at least in our area I think I might had heard something like five or six or more in surrounding areas further out But Ive heard of two Well Im just curious how old were you when this happened And we are Texas natives I grew up in Dallas but we were in Ohio for 20 years So where were you _[00:58:38]Q:So I was 90 miles west of Ft Worth Abilene is also kind of a point mark The Clear Fork of the Brazos River comes by South Bend The closest major town is Graham Eliasville is another tiny little town that was oil boom days great big and then shrunk down to nothing and it was that community right there that was floodedA:So were you out kind of on the farmland or ranch and everythingQ:Yeah we were We had ten acres and ten miles outside of the city And I was third grade so I was eight when it happened And I remember incredible levels of details but the thing thats most vivid actually is we had oil tankers spill and so when I walked back into my room everythings coated in oil and theres dead frogs that have died all over my carpet And for a third grade girl thats not cool A:Pretty dramaticQ:Its pretty dramatic but Ill never forget this woman from the American Red Cross grabbed me and said Oh honey come here What color furniture have you always wanted And I was like White because everything I see in here is not white And she said Let meA:She re-directed youQ:She totally re-directed me took me over to the church and let me go shopping for my new bedroom furniture And so what I grew up on was furniture donated by the Red Cross Our whole house was donated furniture It was fantastic and it was white with flowers and its still in my bedroom A:How sweetQ:And it was the kind of thing that I always said at some point in my life I didnt know how I was gonna get back involved in helping and paying that forward but its always been a goal of mine A:Isnt that interestingQ:And my kids have been too young for me to jump into several natural disasters And when this happened I literally looked at my family and says It means Im not gonna be around the holidays this year but I need to do it A:I went and looked at your website and actually youre amazing You put me to shame Youre extremely active and prolific and you do an awful lotQ:You know I love what I do I get to do the kind of work I want to do and the kind of research that I want to do and so this isIve always had my crisis and disaster has always been kind of a secondary research area of mine but something that Ive kept alive because I kept knowing somethingmy mobile device interest and I knew they were gonna combine and this has been incredible So let me ask you just a couple more quick things One of the things that we had talked about is mobile devices In the research literature we know that they have several features and Im curious whether you think that they were important And were gonna kind of change this aboutjust say important during the rescue efforts Do you think that it was important to use social media to locate people or was that neededA:No I think it was Social media Yeah or actuallyQ:Or mobile devicesA:No have people not shown you things on Nextdoor yet to document thisQ:They haveA:Because actually I foundsomebody referenced an old site and I was looking at it last night and I think it was from that Monday morning and it was people Im here Rescue me Rescue me Rescue meQ:It was I havent seen thatA:You havent seen that Ill try to find that for youQ:That would be really helpfulA:Do you want me to do it now or do you want to go through your listQ:Yeah lets go ahead and do that if thats something thats straightforwardA:YeahQ:So they were posting on Nextdoor that Im here I need rescue YeahA:And I saw one thank in here I must have been sleeping watching TV or out in the boat or working with my people because a lot of it seemed like I hadnt seen it before Okay So let me see how can I find this Were gonna go over here I may just need to think because this is a massive systemQ:I know A:I use this quite intricately but it is a maze and so when Im in there I know but now coming in you know…Q:And going back I know it can take…A:Yeah so where was that How did I get there I was reading something last night and it triggered me to trace a link down and somehow I got back to it And I was just amazed at what was coming through Maybe Ill need to look at it for you and send itQ:Okay Do you know how to do a screenshot from your phoneA:You know I don't know if I ever have learned to do screenshotsQ:So my grad students taught me because I have never needed to A:YeahQ:Its an iPhone rightA:Mm-hmmQ:You literally hold down the power button and the home button at the same time and you go click like thatA:So power andoh okayQ:The power and home and you go click and itll do that And then it saved it automatically to your pictures Or on my project phone what it doesoh I know my storage is almost full I know I shouldnt do it on my personal phone It saved it in your picturesA:Okay ExcellentQ:And thenA:I used to have that wallpaper onceQ:Yeah and theyre really easyA:I think on my old device Q:then to text You can then just text it to our project phone and thatll work great A:Okay I can show you pictures easily because I had taken them with my husbands phone and I airdropped them over here to my phone just a few minutes ago And I brought some other stuff but…Q:Actually I can even airdrop if you have picturesA:Yeah I don't know if youre gonna want them but Ill show them to youQ:Okay All right so that was importantA:Yes because people were saying Come help me and then some people were saying probably on Nextdoorany way they could they were reaching out and saying Were still here and nobodys picked us up on the boatQ:Okay A:So no it was used very much of courseQ:All right and obviously reachability then being able to reach people to give them some type of feedback or communicateA:Right definitely because theyre like in Europe and then in New York City and theyre saying How is my home and Im walking to their home and Im saying Its okayQ:Thats interesting yeahA:Other people theyre in Arizona and Will you take pictures And The water is in front of your house but its okay Its at the curb Heres pictures of your houseQ:Interesting so multi-media capability is definitely in thatA:Definitely So what was availabilityQ:So availability means for you to be available to be reached during rescues during emergency responseA:Definitely Yeah you know Sharon and I were communicating back and forth and other people like you know I cant remember now You know the National Guard is here or somebody has this need or whatever or I need to charge my cell phone or whateverQ:Yeah And portability the fact you can take these things with youA:Definitely Q:What about visibility And its kind of like its extremely visible on Nextdoor but outside of Nextdoor its not very visible which I think is kind of an interesting…A:You don't mean visibility to see the device but as far as…Q:As visibility to see rescue efforts to see people be rescued need…A:Yeah because people post videos and news clips interviews We have people that were interviewed and we were on international media People would say Our family is over in another country and they saw our neighborhood and everything like thatQ:Thats a good point because you actually have TV in addition to portable devices that were important thereA:Yeah and you can get all this here and you can share it on you know if youre on Facebook you share it that we are connected through Nextdoor because it focuses on your neighborhoodQ:Yeah What about persistence the fact that its still there is that importantA:YeahQ:And then the fact that you could edit it and changeA:Mm-hmmQ:Okay And then the last thing is association and what association usually means is that to identify to people that youre part of a groupA:I would say yeah Were part of this neighborhood and because of that we feel maybe a little bit safer with youQ:Exactly that makes senseA:Or weve seen you and we have some history with you even though we havent met youQ:Great So yeah so lets look at some pictures and seeA:Okay Ill show you This here now this is what youve probably seen and then well go to my personal pictures What I did my sense wasand people may have said this to youwhen I was there on that Friday with the boat rescues and you know its like heres north or south Lets say this is Memorial Well lets say this is Memorial And heres Crossroads So heres command central This is where you come here And its just a little bit of dry land and then its wet and thats why the boats are able to go in the ditches or in the streets and everything But I rememberwell its interesting how memories fade you know how the reality of it was so amazing and it was like another world and now its hard to get in touch with that But I remember standing there watching all this and seeing boats coming around the curve and it was just like the San Antonio Riverwalk is what I thought ofAnd there were so many I mean lots of them They were backing up and people and they were _[01:09:35] And there was a lot And so anyway so I thought of taking pictures and then I just didn't This these are things that I had seen that came out in the media This is our neighborhood I don't see itit hasnt been identified but I recognize it This isokay well I guess I should probably show you This is Memorial and this is like the edge of Fleetwood So this is northand so this is why these are all the boats And so these are boats coming back from other neighborhoods Theyre not even ours Theyre coming back from maybe Memorial Thicket or Barkers Landing or Eldridge or whatever And you know eventually the mayor had us not doing it because of electricity issues you know electrical issues being concerned that people would be electrocuted And he was of course people didn't like that he wouldnt let them in but thats kind of the way it wasAnd what waswe were sosocial media too okay Again I worked it because you read things you learn things and you watch the media And the mayor was having people go around and they were shutting off electricity And I did not want them shutting off our neighborhood because we were not flooded And so we drastically were guarding that We had air conditioning we had refrigerators We had TVs all that communication And so we were able to stay where everybody else even if they didn't flood most of them were gone if they didn't have a generator because it was hot and everything But let me bring the map up here Im gonna try to connect this to our neighborhood So this north of here is Barkers Landing and this is somethingQ:Mm-hmm a mapA:Okay where this isokay here is Memorial Q:Oh wowA:This is Fox Gate here and this is our eastern and lower area This area all flooded and it flooded up to this house here I think this yard got flooded but I think this was the last house that was really flooded And then the water went this way and then a lot of these people along Fox Gate were flooded but this house here is this house okay And so here is that house and here is this house So this is North Fleetwood and the eastern edge and then this is the southern…Q:This is cool With you showing me how you can identify could you put that over by this picture to let me see how you can use a maptwo different mapsA:Thats not identified and I can say Yeah this isQ:Exactly Its completely not identified but oh my gosh its so interesting A:Yeah And people who you know somebody who was flooding was supposed to come to my house before I came here to pick up something that I didnt need and I was gonna donate and Im always amazed Theyre on Nextdoor but a lot of people you know they don't mine the depths of it and know the capabilities And its amazing theyll say Oh whats your address where do you live Well my gosh you go to my profile and a lot of this most of us have all that information there and you can find me But they don't do that But for some reason maybe like you you really zone in on this and I do too And so when I see this stuff I go Where is this this kind of looks familiar and I just know that this is the way Memorial looked and I know boats were there and I know we have a lovely house over here with a red roof And so I start putting it together and piece things togetherSo anyway theres that This you may have seen This is Eldridge and Memorial So when boats were leaving command central they were going here until the police stopped them ProbablyQ:_[01:14:12] picture yeahA:Okay Q:Cover thatA:Sure Q:So thats Eldridge and Memorial Ive driven past that area A:Yes And Im trying to think We have a guywere really a very organized area Theres a guyIve got him in my contactsthe general manager of the Energy Quarter District and he does this magazine So if you ever wanted to talk with him he would know the business aspectsQ:Oh thats an interesting ideaA:So I can give you his contactsQ:Because if you looked up my information a lot of my work is on workplace communication A:And so one of the other kind of organizational _[01:14:53] Yeah I looked at that a while myselfQ:Yeah but its interesting to me how organizational this study is I had no idea walking into it it was gonna be all about how people organized around rescue effortsA:Right Well you know were business people and so were used to doing projects at work or in the neighborhood Large scale festivals fall festivals or did you hear about thatQ:I didA:Yeah Ive been a co-chair of that one yearQ:Have youA:Yeah and soQ:Was that that folk festival or was it differentA:Well we have a Fleetwood Fall Festival every yearQ:Oh yeahA:And we have over 500 to 600 homes and oh I forget how many people but a pretty big deal So were used to doing things organizing and connecting and utilizing skills and resources like you know how do we solve this problem Well what if we all get together and we do a group project can we get things cheaper So we have history that way So I think thats how those skills translateQ:I do tooA:Okay And I think thisits been a while since I looked at this but this is[reads to herself] Okay Well this would beokay here is Buffalo Bayou So and this is Highway 6 So our areaokay Q:Yall are up there in that cornerA:Yeah in this peach corner here Okay So this is probably the northern parts of Barkers Landing because part of themI don't know this is either running through our neighborhood or parts of Barkers Landing flooded And here this is that little where the water was running that I was trying to tell you about that came from Addicks Yeah I don't know if you might be interested in this pictureQ:Yeah anythingA:Because the water came from here The water came from hereQ:Yeah thats helpful to see kind of how the water from all the different directionsA:Okay All right So Ill show youand actually I think I have access to other peoples pictures but Im not sure that theres that many on there and they may have shown you So lets golets see where these ended up airdropping Okay This isntFriday when I was working command central for the boats this is an African-American lady that lives here And she was concerned about her home They were tellpeople were notsome people were afraid to walk in the water and I guess I was naïve and stupid so I was walking in the water and getting sores from ill-fitting shoes But I was walking in there and so I told her I would walk to her house and take pictures And she was wondering how I was doing so several of these are gonna be her home and it shows that the water is inthis is a cul de sac that its all up in there but it doesnt come up it doesnt damage her home So I took thatQ:Is that a storm drainA:No these are alleys Now maybe Imokay yeah these are good pictures Maybe this was one of the first days that I was walking and just taking pictures ofokay this is the alley to show what was happening Okay HereQ:Showing that its on the road but not quite in someones house yetA:YesQ:Or even in their yard really technicallyA:Right and the pictures I took were on the north side and I didn't walk in to show where the homes were really flooded So most of my pictures are like this Okay This is as far as the water camewell okay lets just say this is our neighborhood And heres the dividing line in the middle This is kind of over in this areaQ:Got it where it was flooded here and here but some of these were left aloneA:Right The water came like this but for the most part in that upper area it was more in the street And so I did not go down in boats or walk here and I didnt go any further south than just a little bit south of the intersection when I went and got those people Q:YeahA:But I heard stories you know people were saying the water was here and people were talking about getting ladders and going in through the second story to get into their homes And a policeman who I gotlives in one of these homes here he didn't flood Hes the one whohe was on duty quite a bit There was lots of police around all the time It was really great He was saying the water down in the Bayou was 20 Q:WowA:But I guessI know people that live on the Bayou so it must notit must haveI don't think it was that high I thinkthe highest I believe I heard was more like in between the first and the second story but I think more the average was more _[01:20:32] feet or something Anyway so some of these people down here they were like out of state and they were wonderingthey had to leave And heres some homes People were flooded out of their homes This is my street and some of our homes were for lease Okay This is a house I was reporting on They were in Arizona and I was taking pictures for security and this is what it looks like Q:_[01:21:00]A:Yeah this is I think the African-American lady This is from her front porch area So its coming up into her yard And so I shareI think maybe these got mixed up when they airdropped I don't know that theyre in the same order as before Im not sure but anyway so I shared pictures with her And this is back with the people that were out of state This I think again is that lady the African-American lady and her garage Now if you use pictures like this though what if itsokay and this is her front porch and showing that her house is safeQ:YeahA:Can you use pictures of peoples homes I mean what if they see it and they go Wow thats my houseQ:You know the bottom line is that were probably not gonna publishA:Maybe if you want to use itQ:Well we havent tracked who is this coming from The thing is well probably if we want to publish something itll be out of a publicsomething thats been published by the mediaA:Right Q:If we want anything in a publication because we don'twere not interested in the specifics and I cant even really imagine that were gonna publish the pictures The way were actually using the pictures is were going in and were manually human coding them to identify what the characteristics are whats in there is there water is there a house is there a tree What makes it look real when its a real situation Then were gonna train our computers to be able to recognize those kind of pictures And our hope is that in this flood of images we can pick out a real flooding situationA:Right You know I would be willing to go to that lady and ask ifyou know and this is the front of her house coming up you know and back into the cul de sac So these are the homes that are not flooded but it got pretty darn closeQ:Absolutely it did WowA:And Im not sure which daywell September 3rd so I don't know if thats the Friday but they were takingoh actually this is still on the north side so this is where its not so bad This is the homethis home was the last one that flooded and then down south of there to the east Okay More homes for lease because people don't haveokay heres the people that were out of the state and showing the water came thereQ:YeahA:And thereI went back several days I don't know if you want any of thoseQ:Thats helpfulA:Okay So if you remember what came from who Id be glad to touch base with people to see if you could use the picturesQ:Yeah I don't see us using pictures that wayA:This is I think again that same African-American ladys house And you see the water here and it stops there Q:Wow She was fortunate Awfully closeA:And this is again the people out of state just mixing things up Q:Oh thats inA:Yeah this is again from her front porchQ:Yeah I tell you she must have been both simultaneously relieved and freaked out at the same timeA:Yeah I think she was very relieved once she saw the pictures you know I shared throughI probably shared it She probably gave me her cell phone number and I probably texted it to herQ:YeahA:But if youve met Steve Wormald[01:24:40] he put together a site on Nextdoor where were supposed to share our pictures And I can access it I don't think I ever did put my pictures there I should but anyway so again just showing that their home is safe And again the water Yeah so this is really mixing things up Theres the eclipse So theres thatQ:No thats very helpfulA:YeahQ:That really is because in the context of knowing that this is safe you know and the idea of sharing images to show people that they were okay if they werent physically present I don't know that Ive thought threw just exactly how important that is and I think thats really important A:And I know one family their house was not flooded They had a generator but they had lost power The woman is disabled and they left anyway And they posted on Nextdoor they had concerns People would just say If anybody has time or whats the water level like here Or you could just hear that they were concerned and you know I was willing and able and so I walked and I took pictures and then I would report back on Nextdoor private message or whatever And then theyd be very gratefulQ:Of course A:So it was very helpfulQ:Thats great This is exactly what I was hoping for so thank you so much I really appreciate you being willing to share Your experience is unique and but you played a really important role in the rescue in this support role rightA:Yeah and it was really critical when everybody else is in chaos and lost and they need some people that are grounded and mobile and can hold out a little bit of sanity in the midst of the chaosQ:That makes senseA:TheresI guess theres one or two other things that Ill share with you in case youre interestedQ:YeahA:Ill try tothereI had just learned I think at the Super Neighborhood meeting the other day theres a man who is in the Westchester area and their area really flooded a lotQ:Yeah it didA:And I was told that I guess he has some sort of learning disability which I didnt realize but he hadand hes on there and he has a drone And so he would fly drones and he has pictures from the drones because their area was flooding because of city drainage and infrastructure issues like in June thered be a teeny rain and within two weeks their homes would have like three and four times within two weeks their homes were flooding in JuneQ:NoA:Yes and so they were already you know from the Tax Day flood and Memorial Day flood and then this you know theyre battling these issues And then when this comes theyre totally wiped out But I don't know if that would be interesting to you to connect with somebody like that and get some drone images Q:That would beA:Because hes posting that on NextdoorQ:very interesting I don't have any drone images except whats publicly available out there which theres a lot but this ianything I grab thats public I never know for sure if its real or notA:RightQ:And so I try to be really careful and only include things in our data set that real people say they took and then I know everything thats in theres realA:Well you could alwaysmaybe you could check with some of your contacts to see if like here if we can connect and sayQ:YeahA:They may recognize that and give you some evidenceQ:Exactly A:Well this guys name is David Goodall so maybe what I can do is try to reach out to him and then see if he might be willing to contact youQ:Yeah that would be greatA:And then theres other people that are very involved in flooding over there but also I want to find that link for you Okay Just the feed so the Nextdoor feed asking for helpQ:YesA:Okay And theres so much in there LikeQ:I know theres gotta be just an unbelievable amountA:I mean so I mean it would be very difficult to go back in and find a lot for you because it kind of begins to disappear and its hard to go back but I can send you that I was gonna show youQ:I have very similar kind of multiple calls for help from Facebook feeds from Instagram and from SnapchatsA:People are reporting Ah interestingQ:And so its fairly common that people reported these calls for help through social mediaA:YesQ:And then quite often people got the help they asked forA:Right Oh I would think especially in close-knit communities like oursQ:Absolutely rightA:I would think 100% virtually Yeah Im pretty active and so I guess Ive onlyin almost three years Ive only made 243 posts but over 3000 replies and thanks and welcomes and stuff So its hard to navigate to go back and specifically find But I will try to find that Thats one feed I found last night asking for helpQ:That would be greatA:Okay And is there anything else thatI don'tI cant think of anything else that weve covered that we brought up thatsQ:Thats really pretty right on target since the whole goal of the project is to classify and understand calls for help so yeah absolutelyA:Well did I waste your time did I tell you too much or off topicQ:Not at all No Imone of the key things that I want to understand is how the different platforms functioned and part of what surrounds a call for help is response And so if I were to categorize you I would categorize you in the support role to a responseA:And a connectorQ:And a connector thats right And that is a role that I didnt know existedA:Oh reallyQ:Before I started the project I didnt realize that but there are a ton of people who played these connector and these behind the scenes roles and they enabled the people on the boats to go get their jobs doneA:ExactlyQ:And it makes complete sense now that its coming out in the data Im like well of course youve got to have somebody coordinating It makes senseA:Sharon for sureQ:Yeah absolutely these connecting roles are vital But I don'ttheyre also hidden roles quite often Media didn't interview those peopleA:Right They did interview Sharon but theyre pretty much out there you know and a littlekind of flamboyant a little bit you know Q:Thats rightA:But youre right I can understand it The other person II did think of another one The Energy Corridor DirectorQ:YesA:And I can probably find out prettyQ:Okay A:Did you talkhave you talked to people from Memorial ThicketQ:I have not been over there at allA:Okay Well let me see I know someoneare you coming back for anymore interviewsQ:Yes I will beA:Greg Sergsetter[01:31:59] he is the former president of our Super Neighborhood and he lived inhes actually very bitter I can tell Hes a lawyer and I can you know I can tell hes really hurt by this but I might send him a notice and see if he might be interested in contacting you But he could talk about that and he has somebodyhas lots of political connections so hed probably have a good insights Okay My mind is going blank on the name so lets say Energylets try Corridor and see if I can find…Q:This is the person who publishes that newspaperA:Here it is Well he is the General Manager and Executive Director of the Energy Corridor District And would you like me just to send you his contactsQ:Yeah that would be greatA:Okay So I think youve given me your cell phone so lets share the contact Okay Can II can airdrop that cant IQ:You know my phone I think is too old to have airdrop workA:I see you showing up hereQ:Oh maybe let me try itA:Yeah it sendingQ:I got it perfectA:Okay Good Oh in fact I guess I could airdrop any of those picturesQ:You could actuallyA:Do you want me to send u…Q:Lets go right ahead and do thatA:Okay So well go back and try to pull out those eclipse ones that kept interfering If some end up in there that don't have water like Im gonna try toQ:Well just delete those thats not a problemA:Its just they got in there by mistake Its not easy to tell Do you want me to send you a picture of homes for lease just to say we communicated about you know people were needing homes and so we were likeQ:YeahA:Okay So Ill just give you one just so itll trigger that remembranceQ:Okay A:Okay Two things are showing up now the research and youQ:Okay Send them to the research because theres more storage on the research phone than my phoneA:Right So youve gotten the contact Q:I got the contactA:Do you want me to send it to the other place tooQ:No thats fine Ill do that thereA:Okay Q:But if youoh great airdrops right here I can accept Yeah 25 photos Thats wonderful Okay A:Okay So I gave you that and I will look for something and Ill contact a couple other people and see if they might be of help to youQ:Okay Wonderful A:Okay And then Im trying to think Another thing too this might be interesting slightly Other than thatokay well peoplejust a little stuff that I did not a big deal but I help people do a little bit of washing of stuff They brought it to my home and Ive done that but thats not that big of a deal except that I could see from social network they would say Were gonna be at our house today and then I actually had free time and so I actually went over there and connected and said Is there something I can help you with And actuallyand then it got me over on the south side and then I went over and connected with some people where there had been some conflict and it got resolved you know So all that kind of comes through this but what I started out to tell you is people are sharing resources so much about you know all kind of resources from A to ZAnd I have some friends that live up in this area and they were flooded And theyre noteither theyre not on Nextdoor or theyre not connected to us and so I took information that I learned from Nextdoor about resources and shared them with them And so again theres that connecting and cross-pollinating And so its just a way to do itQ:Do you know very much is this neighborhoodBear Creekare they very connected as a neighborhoodA:I think this is Bear Creek Oh I have a friend I went and I spent a day helping them clean upQ:ReallyA:Would you like me to see if shed want to talk to youQ:I would because I just interviewed a police officer earlier today who was stationed and he rescued people out of Bear CreekA:Right Q:And I kept asking him if heif the neighbors were coordinating if he heard anybody talking about social media and he said he didn't And so Im trying now to figure out is that because police is on a very different system you know its walkie talkie its radio Its differentA:They started connected with us or are they not that connectedQ:Right And Im trying to figure that outA:My guess would be that theyre not as connected and like I say you know Im not trying to brag but I really do think that our neighborhood really uses this very wellQ:I think you use it more than anybody Ive talked to by farA:And because of that were kind of like role models or halves of the sphere and so weve pioneered this and weve established these relationships And then as Nextdoor itself corporate connects us with more neighborhoods were able to reach out and share from what weve already developed Q:Yeah and yall have already experienced the good the bad and the uglyA:Oh yeahQ:And so youve kind of been through that and thats just the norms of human natureA:Exactly yeah Theres no way to get around it I don't thinkQ:I don't eitherA:So anywayQ:YeahA:So have you talked to people from Barkers LandingQ:So I have and Ive talked extensively to people in Katy A:Okay Q:So I have a whole network in Katy thats helped me understand that area And Im really staying in this West Houston area because this is all about flooding and I realized very quickly that the hurricane is a totally different situation And there was not really high wind here There was notit was a very different disasterA:Yeah Well its because the hurricane meandered in and stalled and the storm systems hung over and flooded us So thats how its connected And then you know are you getting into the lawsuits and thingsQ:I wont because everythings about rescueA:Okay Well because thats again social media And actually rescuing Its not physical rescue but its the recoveryQ:Youre right it is YeahA:You know like okay what was interestingand you may have heard thisis that we have several attorneys in our neighborhood and they usually are very discreet and very quiet and not on social media but they came together and they put their skills together to figure out how is the best way for us to attack this and who do we recommend And one of them I think had been a student of one of the guys that had done a lot of researchkind of like youon what is it its sort of that eminent domain Theres a title a legal termQ:YesA:But its when they take your land without compensating So he has studied and has experience and so because of these connections through here they connected They put their minds together researched make recommendations and people decide what lawyers they want to go with and they come together And so all this gets sharedQ:It does it really doesA:And so its rescuing but its not physical rescueQ:Right exactlyA:Okay Well thenQ:Thank you this is wonderfulA:Youre welcomeQ:Oh last thing Im sorry I almost forgot If you dont mind I have four demographic questions and if you would fill that out for me Its just right there at the very endA:Sure Im about to be 63 but Im still 62Q:I wouldnt have known thatA:Thank you People tell me that Okay So thereQ:WonderfulA:And political things again probably outside your reach Theres a lot politically that were not happy with Theres issuesQ:YeahA:People donated for the victims but yet the politicianwell wenot 100% but a lot of thisthis tends to be more conservative and republican stronghold so were not the major constituents of our current mayor and the way everything has been slanted is its onlyand youve probably heard this is that the only people that are getting the donated funds its not even government funds its being means tested by income level And even though our city councilman has fought and fought and fought with the mayor to get changes and supposedly its supposed to change but were hearing that it really isnt just because you know we are you know better off more affluent were not the most wealthy in the world but were more affluent But none of those donated funds are coming to us and the poor areas of town they flooded for like 24 hours and it went away These people were flooded for 15 days and like your family wiped out for decadesQ:Thats rightA:And these funds are not coming to _[01:42:22] So I don't know if thats anything thats interesting to you And these are things that get communicated on social media Q:Of courseA:Its a big issue And another thing I thought of is not youre bailiwick but because of my background something that was interesting if I was still in school or doing research I could seeit would have been interestingwell just the psychological impact is interesting to watch the stress reactions It wasnt long enough at that point to be post-traumatic stress but the helicopters going overhead or even rain and you have stress reactionsQ:I noticed You know its weird but I have been nervous when it rains by doing this study This makesIve seen so many pictures of what rain can do that its like whoa So yeah No I agree with you Im sure that there are people out there that are studying this from a psychological perspective and reaction andA:Yeah what do they call that because I havent been practicing for a while but secondary trauma secondary stress exposures like youre expecting But I noticed this the first time during 9/11 We were in Canton Ohio and the plane that went down in what was it in Pennsylvania was circling was up overhead And so I remember hearing about that and thenprobably all over the countrywhen they eliminated the planes from flying for several days everything was so quiet And then whenI always loved planes My father was a pilot a private pilot but then a plane would go over and I would have this stress reaction And its the same thing that I noticed here and I know other people did tooQ:Yeah Well the one thing Ive noticed is that theres so many psychological services that are being offered for free or low cost in the area Its all over the placeA:YesQ:Everywhere Ive looked people can pretty much turn and get help which is needed very much And so thats been kind of encouraging to seeA:Right but you know I don'tI think a lot of peoplewell I know at a church that we used to go to theyre serving a lot of the members in that way but personally I think Nextdoor is a support groupQ:Thats so interesting I think youre probably right about thatA:It really is Because youre not alone And then we would get together and have barbeques You might have heard about that and everythingQ:YeahA:And people could meet and talk and get this outQ:Thats so interesting the informal nature of coping is something that I would say is an undercurrent in a lot of the comments that people have said And the other thing thats been kind of interesting is that for the most part people who have talked to me have said thank you and theyve enjoyed sharing their story And of course Im very appreciative but its kind of nice whenever it feels like maybe it was something they wanted to do too When its bidirectional its really perfectA:Right and its helpful becauseQ:Yeah it is A:somebody is interested in their story and it doesnt have to stay bottled insideQ:Thats exactly right A:Well thank you for your timeQ:Oh absolutely Thank you for your timeA:So Ill take theseQ:Please do and if you notice anything else feel free to send it my way And thank you for these These are wonderful And turn this offEND OF RECORDING [01:45:51]John EnergyA:I helped others I wont say rescued So my experience is a little bit different because I have been through Katrina So I knew I need to grab all [00:00:17] in no hesitation from the very beginning So Sunday morning my [00:00:25] was flooded like four five feet of water Sunday morning around 7:00 8:00 AM Then the National Guard arrived in boat to knock our doors My home was elevated like six stairs  six steps My wife was discussing with me like if we need to go Basically I told her No lets go Even our house would [00:00:48] flood during hurricane but flooded later on But during hurricane we were fine I though We need to run away So not a bad decision  not a difficult decision I just told the boats We will go Just give us 20 minutes We pack then we go But you know almost 90% of our neighborhood did not go that morning And later on [00:01:14] the river  the current was unbelievably bad And no one can rescue them So they have to either stay in the house through the hurricane  like 20% or 30% Other people broke the fence in the back and ran away So I think you can share this with other people Grab all the chance to run away Do not hesitateQ:So I would love to know more about  that you were rescued You said you participated in maybe helping other people alsoA:Yes I did So [00:00:12] different with Peters situation Our community is a townhome in Memorial So basically we have two different age groups One is  one age group is like retirement that downsizeQ:ReallyA:Yes But my townhome is just like 20 30 families So the other ones like our age  very  relatively young but we have kids [00:00:47] we cannot afford a house So we buy the townhouse there So its very funny We are neighbors with [00:00:54] more close in age group because our kids play together And the senior  they play golf They dont work So even we know each other but we dont talk much These are the two groups But during the hurricane they set up a Facebook during the hurricaneQ:They didA:They did And then they start to post pictures [00:01:23] to me Its a shame [00:01:26] I was too busy But again as I said Pete said we [00:01:33] develop a relationship by that time But in my case in my community we develop a relationship [00:01:40]Q:You did it during the hurricane because you had to help each otherA:Yes Because I told you 90% people did not evacuate And they were stuck in the flood for a week For a week no kidding Because we live by bayou We live by bayou so once the government release the water basically thats like a swamp I mean full of current Nobody can go And the boat cannot come to pick up people as well because too strong current So those people just [00:02:14] stuck in the flood I dont know They told me some stories But [00:02:21] here there who evacuatedQ:They did come countA:Because thats so funny Theres no electricity Even they do have electricity For sure they do [00:02:33] Maybe they watched TV but no refrigerator no kitchen And how can like [00:02:41]Q:Did people bring supplies to youA: [00:02:51] bring supplies to my area I was evacuated I was not there But if people can bring supplies they pick them up right [00:02:58]the people rightQ:They couldnt even get there to pick people upA:Yes very strong current Very strong currentQ:I didnt realize thatA:Yeah why evacuated on Sunday morning  the first day I told you the water was around four feet five feet So later the National Guard have to use some engine boat to [00:03:23] but go out you want to use a boat no way Too strong current But at that time its only four feet Later on its probably like 10 feet How can they come to pick up They have to respond with their life tooQ:Wow Did people get rescued or were there people there that didntA:A lot of people  20% -- probably around seven eight feet they come again saying Theres lot of current Need to go We cannot come So most the people just left that day I believe it was Monday afternoon But after that no one can come And the 20% people was stuck there And my neighbor just beside me  my neighbor was there with two kids  two boys And they were scared eventually at the end Because water  its not only about food its about the environment The water is so dirty The smell the germs And there are two kids around her age  three four So the husband just broke the fence Piece of fence  it belonged to the house in the back But its like a mansion house  really really rich people But he doesnt care He said OK whatever Use a hammer break the fence And I think people just  maybe half the water [00:04:47] in the back Just work our way The neighbor was fine He said I understand Ill fix it laterQ:But thats good So what  I am kind of curious about this Facebook group that your neighborhood set up You said you never accepted their invitationA:I should I didnt have timeQ:Whats the name No I mean if it doesnt help you then I certainly understand that Whats the name of that neighborhood Because I might be able to get in touch with them to see if they would be willing to let me look at thatA:Naughton N-A-U Q:MA:N for NancyQ:N-A-UA:G-H-T-O-N Naughton Townhome probably [00:05:29] Facebook had like Naughton Townhome or whatever So you can search Our HOA is pretty strong because we are like 20 30 houses The in charge of people is called Ben Wheeler [00:05:42] the same group a lot He has a daughter or whatever [00:05:48]Q:Oh the same ageA:Not the exact same But with my elder daughter probably they can play togetherQ:OK interesting So you said it was on Memorial This is on Memorial in that areaA:In that area yesQ:Yeah Ive driven through all that area And so Im somewhat familiar with what that is Let me see if there were other things Oh what do you remember about the people who rescued youA:Its hard to tell Well its  I cannot remember his name now But it was a  well if you dont experience that you probably cannot fully understand You will understand but not fully understandQ:Im fully  yeahA:So while were on that boat each boat can only carry two families So the first round I sent my wife and my two daughters out because theres not enough seat They only come like three times So total last time I believe was around six eight families They have to go to another place to save other people Well this was [00:07:00] I cannot believe The last round it was me alone And with another senior family Well it was a complete  and people are crazy by that time They were  the husband was [00:07:19] In the morning my neighbor [00:07:22] a lady probably like 60 years old was screaming was screaming Its like complete screaming Her husband [00:07:34] whatever dragged her back to home Dragged her  I saw that She was like mad  got in her car was like flooded It was so deep water My home area was never that bad  never So she was crying And I saw her husband just drag her [00:07:54] Youre OK Youre OK Where are you Were going to save you [00:08:01] they cannot think They cannot think The other senior couple [00:08:14]they were just funny They spent like five minutes The female lady spent like five minutes to do their curtain No kidding Just to [00:08:24] them up Put the curtain higher without touching the water About five minutes The National Guard was like so frustrated Said Why And people said Why The curtains so important or your life is important or other peoples lives are important So its like a crazy And I can barely think I thought [00:08:48] serious mistake First of all I did not bring my key Because my key was my remote I thought OK if the remote got water I mean the remote is a hundred bucks I dont want to get attached with it You can take the key and use a remote whatever But I just [00:09:08] and I got my car get the garage remote I said OK at least good enough So stupid because there will not be electricity later on [00:09:20] basically I lock myself outsideQ:But youve never been through that before so thats not necessarily on your radar in terms of things that you would prepare forA:Yes I remembered to take the gun take the cash take  what else The car key for the other car But it was funny I mean by the time  its just like 20 minutes I slept well My wife worried I slept well My wife waked me up because she heard the whistle outside asked me to look outside You know in New Orleans it was like people started robbing almost at the same time So she was afraid She was afraid to look outside Asked me Look outside So I was [00:10:09] hourQ:So since you also went through Katrina I am curious What was the difference between the two experiencesA:People Myself Myself So what I want to say is  maybe you can make a document Its called a document A movie right DocumentaryQ:Oh is it onlineA:No no I mean maybe you can make some document story Not movie like an interview Like you shoot it [00:10:40] what I read from article from the movie it cannot comparable to talk with the people and comparable you have with hearing that yourselfQ:I agreeA:From Katrina I learned a lot Because my wife and I were the last of seven Chinese evacuated from New Orleans We were evacuated by military helicopter So we made a series of mistakes in Katrina And now this time and not smart at all because I made too many mistakes last time So this time I learned the lessons So if you can interview with the people like  not  like who made mistakes Do not who are lucky but make mistakes Talk to them They will tell you Do not spend five minutes to make your curtain Just leave right away So they will understand right now But at that time basically [00:11:44] fire They dont know where to go but they dont feel comfortable They see the curtain OK I make the curtain They see the door I make the door Their mind is out They dont know which one is important You have to experience that You have to really really prepare themQ:Yeah I think youre probably right So then you were able to take that knowledge of you need to just act and you need to get out quickly from learning that from Katrina and apply that in this situationA:No hesitation There are a couple things in my mind You get the chance to evacuate means you are safe Not am I safe My kids are safe My wife and my family are safe Nothing is more important than that This is number one after my mistake In New Orleans basically my wife and I  at that time we did not have kids We were so afraid that we evacuate because we heard  radio We heard what happened in the shelterQ:Oh you heard what happened in the sheltersA:Yes yes You all know that You all know that My wife is an Asian girl by that time I was super afraidQ:ReallyA:I prefer to stay at home I mean we have enough food or water and safe with our 12 friends We were safe So this time I think OK we need to go We cannot let it happen again Thats why I told you I have the gun Its very important because you have experienced thatQ:I bet thats true Were fine I had the other one going so were fine No I understand that makes sense that that having some past knowledge of shelters and of those experiences changes the way that you view this particular situation Im just going to turn it off and then itll quit beeping at usA:I am OK How many time do you have How much time do you haveQ:Were fine I think were  I have a few more questions The main thing that I think would be really helpful at this point is did you ever post any picturesA:Yeah in WeChat I posted Theres one more thing I need to share with you I must share with you Theres a group of people during the disaster I evacuated to my neighbors friends house So there are a lot of Chinese living in Memorial but we dont talk each other right Everybodys busy always So by that time several people started to group people calling the WeChat group And the people were saying OK I got a kayak I got a boat Who needs help [00:14:25] and they did And later on the boat was  got stuck in the land It cannot put on the truck cannot save people [00:14:36] message And I was in my friends home And we two are basically run to that place in the [00:14:44] And run for about like two miles We cannot drive We cannot drive because its a land water land water We run there trying to help By the arrival there the boat already out because other people come from closer to help them [00:15:02] probably like 10 families [00:15:10] families  they should leave earlier They have the chance They stay there But later on some National Guards are still people Theyre not machine They need to rest And more and more people start to calling help And they try to help you but they dont have the results So they were stuck So thats why the people [00:15:37] the neighborhood start to help And then later on like the boat was stuck in the land because most people were tiredQ:Yes they were tired Yes absolutelyA:So once you have a chance to leave do not hesitate Just go You have  [00:15:54] they dont fear of that once it happens [00:15:58] Thats exactly what happened to them But ask them If it happens again what will they do They just leaveQ:Probably so Thats right So thats really  that is very helpful So is it  shes fabulousA:Thank youQ:I mean fabulous Im like I will take you home with me And I dont say that very often So she is great I tell you she can be my friend I tell you Is that your phone though I hate to ask her what  is there a possibility if we gave you our phone could you log in on our phone and look at your WeChat and choose some images to share with us  to show us what you posted I dont want to take your phone away from herA:Thats fineQ:You sure Youre so good What is your nameA:What is your nameA2:JoyA:JoyQ:Joy Joy you are an awfully good kid I tell youA:So this is a picture Thats my friend We stayed in their family Thats waterQ:Thats water That would be really helpfulA:How about on the boatQ:Do you know how to do screenshotsA:I can send the picture to youQ:That would be great Lets just do a screenshot And Ill give you that address Thank youA:I have a lot of pictures Its only one picture I have like probably 1000 But you dont need so manyQ:You know if you have a bunch I would take a bunch Whats the  were here for the next several days And so were actually going to be coding and looking through images while its fresh in our mind Is there any chance you could send it to us fairly quickly so we can get on it and take a look at some of those images Tonight evenA:Can you come to my home todayQ:We canA:Ill make a copy for youQ:That would be perfect We can do that Lets get your address Im going to go ahead and wrap this up formally And let me get that address from you Let me see here I think I can just turn it off Or turn it  let me hit that Go here StopEND OF RECORDING (00:18:11)John PoliceA:No problemQ:Okay And then the other thing I do as I start is what do you want your name to be It does not need to be your real name Usually I ask for a pseudonym So either a name that you like or just a plain normal name is fineA:Just call it John I guessQ:John okay All right Great So share with me how did you get involved in the rescue effortA:Im a police officer so we were called out to do it yeahQ:How does that workA:Well we get phone calls any type of an emergency comes about were on call We are on call and we were called out Unfortunately due to road conditions I wasnt able to make it the first dayQ:Okay I would think that would probably have happened to a lot of people rightA:Correct yeahQ:And so any time theres an emergency yall are considered on callA:Yes we are always on callQ:Interesting I didnt realize thatA:Mm-hmmQ:Does it happen very oftenA:Not very often only on natural disasters or inclement weather hurricanes or snowstorms where they need manpowerQ:Yeah So which area did you work inA:I was on the west side of town in Bear Creek area Highway 6 clean routeQ:Oh okay yeahA:Near the reservoirQ:Near Memorial that area thatA:Yeah we were actually north of I-10 on the Bear Creek Reservoir which is just north of the Addicks Reservoir So theres two areas thereQ:Okay All right And Im also kind of curious in terms of your organization do yall have training for these types of thingsA:Theres really not a lot of training that can be had for natural disasters other than just planning and organization and trying to deploy to areas that need help and stuff but…Q:So Ive talked to people who have been volunteer rescuers Ive talked to people who worked with National Guard Im kind of curious what type of a role do the police play in actual rescuesA:Well it really depends on the tools available I mean myself we had one of our officers who actually brought his personal boat in so me and him were paired up and we were actually doing swim and rescues and going into homes and carrying people out We did that for three daysQ:Oh my gosh what kind of hoursA:Basically from daylight until about dark We wouldnt do any nighttime water rescues or anything like that at night for obviously safety reasons but yeah from daylight until darkQ:So yall went in the water swam in pulled people out Were you told to go to certain areasA:Yes we were I was assigned to the Bear Creek area the Bear Creed neighborhood and thats kind ofwhen we responded to any kind of calls or anything we saw we just acted on and helpedQ:How did you get notification of who to go rescueA:Well we actuallythe people would call either 9-1-1 or call the department phone number and they would relay it to our radios But I also was in contact with several citizens who were actively helping there in the neighborhood and I provided my personal cell phone number so they were texting me peoples addresses and stuff that they came across or would hear about somebody I needed to rescue and they would text me while I was out there And then wed go out there and check the home and rescue them if need beQ:Wow Is that an area that you normally patrolA:No Im an investigator so I cover all of Harris County but Im familiar with the area because Ive worked in that area before so I knew the streetsQ:So these were just random people who you gave your personal cell phone number toA:Correct yeahQ:And was that a pretty common practiceA:It kind of became thatQ:Thats what Ive heardA:But its not normal But in that circumstance in that situation you pretty much had to do it Q:Yeah Im amazed atso Ive been studying personal mobile phones for quite a while and especially how people bring their own devices to work And Im hearing that more and more that that was just the way you get work done in a disaster as well which I think that a lot of people wouldnt think about that Was there ever a time that you used social media or was everything texting for youA:Everything was texting for us yeahQ:And then your police radiosA:And police radiosQ:And dispatch like thatA:CorrectQ:Did you coordinate with any of the volunteer groups that were there for rescuesA:Yes Yeah there were some citizens came in with their boats volunteering and if we were out there we would try to pair an officer with a volunteer that way theyd always have an officer on the boat and one or two of the volunteers that brought their personal boat That way thered always be some kind of law enforcement presence or radio on board communications And so we did that That kind of developed as everybody showed up and then that worked really well so we could all stay in communicationQ:Yeah Were the same people coming back the same volunteersA:Yes The same people and they kind of became the regulars Theyd show up and its like Okay The same guys were with you yesterday Yall get in the boat and yall go out and rescue And a lot of it becoming a patrol effort rescue is more of a just monitor the area for you know make sure nothing was catching on fire looters you know youd have people coming back inQ:Yeah exactly In that areabecause what Ive learned is that in different areas they have different policies in terms of whether people could go back in to get pets and medicine and things like that What was the kind of rule of thumb thereA:If your pets were accessible we would allow you to go get your pets There were some volunteers out there from different animal organizations that were trying to rescue animals We actually have an animal cruelty division that were also assisting in people rescues along with animal rescues But we kind of forewarned everybody that Look youre entering an area thats very dangerous for your animal And the electricity was still on in the areaQ:It wasA:Yes And there were several electrocutions where people had died out there which had made the news Thats the area that I was in and so we were just kind of forewarning everybody that we really didn't want you going back in because we actually had to rescue several of the same people multiple timesQ:Did youA:We did because of that Theyd go in on these pool floats or go in on these little stuff they go buy at the store and then get out there then theyd end up needing re-rescue and so now were taking away from our primary job And once weve already rescued them once and we got them back to safety they re-entered and got back into danger again And thats pretty frustrating but…Q:I bet that was frustratingA:YeahQ:Would they literally go and bring pool floatsA:AbsolutelyQ:Ive seen pictures of the pool floats and the noodlesA:Noodles and pools and kiddie poolsQ:Kiddie poolsA:Yeah the air up kiddie pools yeahQ:Wow What about when yall did the actual rescues were people bringing animals with themA:Yes We were trying to get them to If they were there you know if you could get your cats and your dogs and all that wed go ahead and load everything up and get as much as we can out at that timeQ:How was that on the boats to have those animalsA:Well you know most of the people have little kennels for the most part and there were some that did not but overall it was pretty good really not a big issue The only issuewe had one issue where there was a lady she had I want to say around 12 or 13 dogs and about as many cats Q:Oh goshA:Yeah So that was aQ:A full boatA:It was a full boat in just yeah animalsQ:Wow When you were dispatching out to get people tell me about how the water came up in that area was it an overnight quick rise was it gradual over several daysA:I think it was a pretty quick rise over like one night I believe it was like in the street like one evening and then like the next morning it was up in the houses So from what I was told a lot of people were Well its in the street We can get out in the morning and when they woke up it was too deep to get the vehicles out and load up so then they ended up from that point it rose up to I guess 6 or 7Q:Wow It was pretty high in that area thenA:Yeah it was really highQ:Wow and did it stay up there for a whileA:Yeah oh about at least a week it was probably at least 5 and then they probably the last two or three days I worked was it had gotten passable in most areas but it wasthe houses were you know at that pointQ:Oh yeah So it came up quickly so probably your first day you were out there it was go get anybody you could just making passes back and forthA:Well I don't know whether it was the first day that was… But like the first night that the water came in was at the street level thats when everybody should have gotten out but they waited and then it got up too high But thatthe first day I got in there it was you know at theabout a 5 or 6 mark probably out in the street and then it rose the next two days we were out there Then it started gradually started coming down as they released water out of the reservoirQ:Okay So when you would go into an area how did you decide the priority of who you got out firstA:It was really just who we came across for the most part It was just if we came across somebody who needed out wed scoop them up haul them out go back in But most of the people we came across in there were elderly and handicap or disabledQ:Were those when you did the swim in is that when you had to go physically in to get themA:Physically go into the homes and pull them out or they didn't want to leave because they had disabilities or handicap or wheelchairs So we had to carry them downstairs or down ladders and stuff out of the roof And we had some people who actually climbed up in the attics and then we had to cut them out of the atticQ:You did uh yeah I can just imagine that was probably one thing after anotherA:It was crazyQ:And have you seen anything like that beforeA:No Ive neverI mean during Hurricane was it Rita was here and during Katrina and stuff and all that kind of stuff you know we were hearing about that but as far as the widespread you know and I think thats what hurt us the most it was the widespread flooding the entire coast The resources were spread And already the state the county the cities don't have enough resources and stuff to rescue in high waterQ:Exactly So one of the things that Ive realized is that there seems to be a very big difference between a flood and a hurricane You were pretty much deployed for floodA:Mm-hmmQ:I mean it resulted from the hurricane of courseA:Correct but it was a flood rightQ:Yeah Im curious if youve worked in a hurricane before Yall arent sent out to do any type of rescue until its safe for you rightA:CorrectQ:And so in a hurricane that usually means things have passedA:Right afterwards Q:Right and whereasand this also was after the hurricane was through essentially but the water was still rising and all thatA:RightQ:Any thoughts have you worked in a hurricane area versus a flooded areaA:Yeah we didn't have all the down power lines We didn't have the downed trees It was just a rain event The amount of rain was just unprecedented obviously So it was abut yeah Ive been out there in hurricanes where weve had to go get people out of their homes during patrol when I worked then and where we had trees fall on homes and wed assist with getting them out or blocking the roadways until the fire department would arrive with their equipment and cut the power off And the energy company would come out and shut power off and stuff like thatQ:That makes sense So that was probably different So when you had to cut people out they were in the attic or they wereA:Right just retreated up to the attic and then once their house was full of water they were kind of stuck up there And you could see several homes that the homeowners had broken through the roof and gotten outQ:Wow thats amazing So share with me one experience that you remember of a rescue that might be kind of uniqueA:Oh man I don't know there was a couple of them thatand they were all well two were an elderly couple that just had refused to leave didn't want to be a bother Im guessing to anybody Q:Its fairly common yesA:And we talked to them and was able to get them out carry them down the stairs Had another gentleman and his wife Hes a diabetic really large unable to move his leg Had surgery and was all wrapped up bandaged with open wounds And so he wasnt able to move so carried him down the stairs and kept his leg dry We wrapped itbefore we went downstairswith trash bags and duct taped it to try to keep it dry keep it out of the water because we didn't want him to get staph or some kind of infection or something like that And got him out Another lady wasshes diabetic againlarge and in a wheelchair and kind of refused to leave Q:Did you talk people into leaving is that kind of what you didA:We tried yeah we tried really hard because it was you know nobody really knew how long the water was gonna continue to rise or stay standing or how long it was gonna take to drain how long it was gonna take to get the power turned back on or off depending on where theyre at Because some of the homes still had power and we were trying to explain the fire hazards with everything and that if something happens we may not be able to come back to you or you may not be able to get rescued and especially if youre unable to care for yourself things could go bad really fast for you So we really you know were here to get you out Lets get your stuff and then you can come back in a week or soQ:Yeah makes sense Were yall tracking how many people you were getting out does anybody keep anyA:We tried the best we could and wed radio in If we were rescuing people wed radio in that wed rescued two or three people from this address Wed give the address and then wed mark the house that it was clearQ:Was that the spray paintA:The spray paint yeah And so we would spray paint the houses so that wed know that it was clear That way if somebody else had gotten a call there for a rescue theyd know that the house had been clearedQ:Okay I was wondering who was putting those marks on the housesA:The National Guard did a lot of it but we were doing it as well so we could keep track of itQ:Yeah These physicaland then were there people that were hanging whiteA:White sheets out the window that wed drive by in the boat and wed see the white sheet hanging out So wed pull up and then make contact with them and get those people out as well and then wed mark the home and then move on to the next one Because what we were running into before that started we were getting a lot of repeat calls to the same house And so we did go you know multiple people had been getting sent to the same location to do checks and so it was really unproductiveQ:Oh yeah I can imagineA:But that kind of situation just…Q:Yeah So with the people that you gave your personal cell phone to and they were texting you assuming mainly or calling what kind of calls did you get walk me through what that process was likeA:Oh she would just text me Hey this is so and so Ive got another rescue Somebody gave her information and then she would pass it on to me Or if she got word that theres somebody over here that needs help And Im sure the phone lines and all that was overwhelmed so that she was just texting me because she knew I was in Bear Creek area And so I would radio it out if I wasnt close by if I knew that we had other units on the other side of the neighborhood or something like that so we stayed in contactQ:So how was she getting that information do you knowA:Actually I think some of it came through social mediaQ:Thats what I was thinking tooA:Yeah She actually told me that she was getting stuff from Facebook and then the neighborhood websiteQ:Is that Nextdoor by chanceA:It might have been Nextdoor I think it might have been that but she was getting information through there because I think she was on the homeowners association or something along them lines and so she was in communication with everybody and passing it onQ:Its amazing these facilitators In almost every community there was at least oneA:Oh yeahQ:And sometimes multiples that played these kind of conduit roles of connectingA:Well actually I didnt even give her my number I gave my number to another guy who was wanting us to find somebody so I gave him my number So I went to go look for his family or something go check on his family And then I got a call from her that he had gave her my number and then after that it was just me and her texting back and forth the entire weekQ:WowA:YeahQ:And it worked pretty well it sounds likeA:Yeah it worked great yeah Because she was on the ground and so when people would come out or she would get other neighbors or people she knew would call her And of course shed hear about…Q:How big was that neighborhood do you have any ideaA:Several thousand homes I want to say its maybe right around 3000 or 4000 homes in that neighborhood Its pretty largeQ:That is pretty largeA:Yeah it covers from Clay Road Highway 6 up to like Addick/SatsumaQ:Okay A:And then it backs up to the east side of it kind of backs up to theits just a large set of woods Its part of the Addicks ReservoirQ:Okay Interesting Im trying to getI know Ive probably driven in that area Ive done a fair bit of work with groups over off of Memorial and south of I-10 and then Katy Ive talked to a fair number of groups in Katy And so this is just north Its that north area that primarilyA:Yeah Highway 6 yeah just north of Clay Road You go to Highway 6 to cross the reservoir from I-10 going north and then just continue to go north and when you get to Highway 6 its all in there on the right hand sideQ:Okay And all of it was floodedA:Oh yeah yeah from I-10 all the way up to Clay Road actually past Clay Road all the way up toall the way past through the neighborhood It was allthere was I don't know 6-7 of water on Clay Road and Eldridge right there So yeah it was pretty highQ:So Im curious in that neighborhood is it one elevation Could people come in and put a boat in and could you boat them straight out or did they have to have kind of legsA:We were able to just back a truck in with a boat and drop it in the water the first three days and then the water started receding and it was hard to get the boat in the larger boats anyways So the smaller boats were okayQ:Okay So that changed over time So I want you to think about your mobile device and how you used it to coordinate especially with this woman And in our research literature we know that there are certain features in mobile devices that seem to be helpful in general and so one of the things Im trying to do is understand whats helpful and whats not in an emergency or in this kind of situation So was it important for you for your kind of organization or the people you rescued to be located through a mobile device or the fact that they were in the neighborhood that was location enough for you In other words did people pin themselves everA:No I didnt notice anything like thatQ:All right Did you need to reach people with mobile devicesA:Yes we were constantly callingQ:Probably with all of youA:With everybody yeahQ:Okay What about you to be available for other people to reach youA:Absolutely that was constantQ:Okay And what about multimedia It sounds to me like most of the things you talked about doing were texting and phone callsA:YesQ:Were you sharing any images were people sending you imagesA:No We wasntduring that time youre basically just going out doing and not…Q:Exactly You didn't lose your phone did youA:No I didnt thank goodnessQ:There are a number of people I thinkA:I know It got wet but I dried it outQ:Oh thats good What about the portability the fact that you could take it with youA:Yeah absolutelyQ:All right what about visibility If you werent posting things in visible places I don't know that that feature would have been that important for youA:Mm-mmmQ:And persistence has it been important to have any of those text message conversations with this person persist the fact that do you still have them does that matter or when you were done you were doneA:Yeah when I was done I just deleted everything But she actually contacted me later on She was aworked at a charter school so I went and spoke to all of her kidsQ:Oh thats great Thats neat What about association was it ever important that people knew that you were associated with any kind of a groupA:Yes that was extremely important just the presence of seeing a police officer on a boat When we had somebody that was out there maybe up to no good or up there on a pool noodle or something and you told them to leave they would actually for the most part leave whereas those who didn't have a police officer or somebody from the National Guard in the boat theyd just kind of ignore them and move on so it was a huge helpQ:Well what were you wearing that identified your associationA:I was just wearing my uniformQ:So you got out in the water and everything in uniform Did you have waders at least I don't guess they help did theyA:No we were too deep in water for wadersQ:Wow Is it convenient to swim with a uniform onA:Not reallyQ:I just cant imagineA:No I had awell we have BDUs Theyre just like the pocket cargo pants that you seeQ:Oh yes I have seen thoseA:So we have those and we have a dry fit shirt Its a zipper style but its a nice shirt that dries pretty quick And so we had that on but Id take all my gear off I left my gun belt and all that in storage and so wed just hop in and goQ:So you pretty much just wore and took with you things that were pretty resilient to the water and the elementsA:Yeah absolutelyQ:That makes good sense So in terms of communication talk to me some about the use of the radio Could you use the radio when you were on the boatsA:Yes Yeah our handheld radiosQ:Oh okayA:Yeah we have the little handheld we carry on our gun beltQ:Okay All right Did that communication work well not wellA:No it worked great It was just you know theres always any time theres a large number of people using the same channels you know calling in and so theres a lot of trying to talk over each other And that got worked out once things sort of became organized and all that but yeah it worked really well And Harris County has done pretty good and the citys done really good with having a channel that all the agencies can get on and talk and communicate with each other And theyre still working on that I believe but its getting betterQ:Thats great That does seem like its really important to have everybody coordinating through the same placeA:Right it is absolutely And for the most part the way it worked was the city used to they handled stuff within the city limits of Houston obviously They took care of their neighborhoods and thenso almost like everybody got a little piece of the pie to speak up to take care of and work on so everybody wasnt scattered out amongst so that everybody was working in their areasQ:Yeah Could you get to and from workA:Yes I could It was very difficult but we had to take really alternate routes and go a long way around to get to work And then there was a fuel issue whereQ:I was wondering about thatA:Yeah where some of the gas pumps were running out of fuel and so our patrol cars and stuff wasnt able to get fuel But our department somehow got a large tanker so we had fuel for those So basically if you were on north of 10 you couldnt get south of 10 so you were pretty much stuck unless you had a boat or something like that Q:Wow What were things in terms of communication that didn't work well that you saw And that could either be communication between volunteers it could be homeowners anybodyA:I would say the communication between volunteers and the police department or the rescuers and the volunteers The volunteers were wanting to go out and help but at the same time we were trying to coordinate everything to whereso there was that And then getting the word out to the homeowners and so they were being fed stuff that theres looters and that kind of stuff _[00:29:20] catch the news And they think these people are looters when theyre actually people out to try to rescue And so there was that And then we actually set uptried to set up a plan to where anybody that wanted to come back in you had to be a resident You had to show proof of ID You went and checked in at a check-in station or you checked in with an officer that was stationed Because we had them stationed at the entry points of the neighborhood And that worked a little bit but it was pretty hard getting the word out to all the people who lived in the neighborhood And so we know they checked in to get their belongings that they check back out and they left that way we know that they got out safely were not leaving anybody in there overnight or make sure everybody got out safely but that was hard to communicate all that informationQ:I bet Did this person who was with the homeowners association was she ever able to post messages for yall or let people in the neighborhood knowA:I don't know if she did or notQ:Some neighborhoods seemed to be really tightly connected through social media and others not at all Did you ever get a feeling for whether this neighborhood was or wasntA:I don't think it was that tight There was so many people trying to do their own thingQ:That makes sense All right Well one of the last things I always as is is there anything else that I havent asked that you think would be helpful I mean were looking at how people post calls for help receive help you know the role that communication devices and social media play in that processA:The only thing that I saw thatthe biggest issue we had was I guess if youcommunication was getting the word out to the people who are elderly or handicapped or needed medical assistance or something Those are the people who for the most part waited until it was too late that had to go and be rescued And then due to lack of resources we have was getting those people out safely was a chore I mean I would justI mean as far as justI guess early communication early preparedness you know Get out when the gettings goodQ:Yeah absolutelyA:Get out while you can dont waitQ:Thats right And in that area they knew were they under voluntary evacuationA:That Im not sure of They were mandatory evacuation later on because water got inbut there were some people we just we left behind They just refused to come out of their home completely and so we marked their home accordingly And then wed go by and check on them over the passing days Wed check on them and see if they needed to come back out because once the power went out their communications went down The phones went dead and what have you and so wed just kind of go on by and just Hey you want out now No were goodQ:Yeah Well Ive always heard that in hurricanes people kind of fall into one of two categories They either evacuate when theyre told to evacuate or they hunker down and board up and theyre thereA:They ride it out yeahQ:And they know that nobodys gonna come rescue them until its safe for people to get back out Did you sense that that was the same here or not so muchA:For some of the people that we left that wanted to stay behind they had that mentality were just gonna hunker down stay here Well be okay And Im like…Q:I knowA:We had some that had little children babiesQ:Oh no that stayedA:Yeah that wanted to stay And we just said Look give us the kid You want to stay go ahead and stay I cant leave a three-month-old or you know up there Youre not gonna have electricity I said Its gonna be out for weeks I said It could be a week or two before the water goes down enough to even get out You know nobody really knew how fast the water would go down or if it would rise anymore or what And it was already up to the ceiling of the first floor so youre looking at 7 of water or so And these people are all up on the first floor I said Yall have no food electricity water I said You have no way to get in and out And those are the same people we rescued twice come back in yeahQ:WowA:YeahQ:Huh Now when people had to be rescued twice were they just unaware of this… WhyA:Go on back to get papers insurance papers you know just personal belongings One guy wanted to come get hisIm not making this up a coconut crackerQ:Im not surprised yeahA:His business was he madesold coconut juice or made drinks or something so it was this Brazilian he said coconut cracker or machine I don't know it was real huge and he floated in on a pull float and strapped it on the pull float and floated it back out Q:WowA:Thats how he made his money so he had to go get itQ:Of course So some of the people who came in but then had to be rescued a second time did they not understand currents or did their float pop or they got uncomfortableA:A lot of it was just their floats popped holes in themQ:Thats what I can imagineA:You know so then theyre up neck deep you know Fortunately there wasnt a lot of current but the problem was theres manholes Covers are blowed up There were cars completely submerged I mean theres all kinds of debris in the water I mean we _[00:35:45] on several cars on a boat got stuck on cars that you couldnt see And then as the boats and stuff rescuers were going down the water the cars would float and move So where it was one day over here on the right it may have floated over to the left a little bit and you end up hitting it And so now youre marking it again and so it was until the water went down enough you just didn't know So but people were out there in that and…Q:Did yall have a prop on your boatA:Oh yeah a propQ:And motors and were yall hitting thingsA:Yeah big Its a big boat yeah And we took it slow but yeah it was huge Saw alligators out thereQ:You did see alligatorsA:Saw alligators like three of them out thereQ:So the first time I heard that I thought people were making it up I thought it was a rumorA:Oh no for real You know Addicks Reservoir and Bear Creek theres alligators in those creeksQ:I did not know thatA:Yeah absolutely Yeah theresthey get reports all the time about alligators up  in the park you know up on the bank of the creek or down in the park Yeah theres tons of alligators over in the Addicks Reservoir Q:You know the most embarrassing thing for me to admit is that Ive lived this close to Houston and Ive neverI didnt realize there were Bayous I didnt realize Houston was a whole lot like New OrleansA:It is It really isQ:And nowA:Its just spread out in a larger areaQ:It is and I just reallyIve been here many many times and now as Im driving through neighborhoods and people are showing me where the water came up I was like Huh never noticed that before And I think a lot of people live hereeven live in Houston and have never kind of made that connectionA:Oh yeah Well like Bear Creek if you come inif you come off the toll road and you go west on Clay Road and you hit the Bear Creek Reservoir theres a levy that you drive over and you come back down Okay that hump in the road is not a hump in the road just to have a hump in the road Thats the levy So as you come downQ:Over the levy on Clay RoadA:you go over the levy on Clay Road theres the neighborhood So youre insidethe neighborhood is built inside the levy Q:And the first time I drove through Addicks the Addicks Reservoir I was driving intoout in Katy I was driving in from one direction and then all of a sudden one day I had to drive around and Im like oh its right there Its like if they stood up on their roof they could see it right there a quarter of a mile away And so I found that pretty eye-opening just in terms of the geography that people are not necessarily aware ofA:Right yeah They drive over it every day not even aware that hump theyre driving over is the levy And so youre living inside of a levyQ:Thats pretty crazyA:Exactly yeahQ:So the last thing I always do is if you don't mind let me just get four demographic questions and itll go with your pseudonymA:Oh for meQ:Yeah for youA:Okay Q:And I so appreciate thisA:Oh no problemQ:How many years have you been a police officerA:Eighteen yearsQ:And you said youre an investigatorA:Yes ma'amQ:So what type of cases do you usually coverA:I am assigned to the Environmental Crimes Division so I do illegal dumping water pollution air pollution casesQ:Do you like thatA:I do because Im real big on the outdoors and fishing and hunting and so protecting the environments pretty important Our fisheries and all the bays and watersQ:Thats greatA:Yeah But yeah so thats what I doQ:Wow This must have been a change of paceA:Yeah it was But Im kind of at home in a boat so I mean… But it was you know it was just one of those things that just had to get done I mean thank goodness we had all the volunteers that we hadQ:And so Im headed to Florida the second week of January and from everything I can tell thats gonna be the biggest difference is that in Houston there was a call for volunteer help becauseA:PeopleQ:You didn't have enoughA:YeahQ:You couldnt have pulled it off another wayA:Same thing with New Orleans I mean theres people in Houston or Texas I mean I had people call me fromIll sponsor some teams in Pennsylvania Austin They were calling bringing their boats down here from PennsylvaniaQ:Oh my gosh This is fishingA:Yeah some fishing teams I sponsor so they were like Where do you need us at Im like Im just one guy in a big town I don't know where to come If you want to come come on So but I had people from all over the state that Ive met and they were calling And I was coordinating with those guys because you know those guys were volunteers frommost of them were police officers from out of state or out of town and they were coming in so they were calling me Where do I need to go Im like The first high water you get to start helping Don't come to me just find a place and help and everything will get done But had it not been for the volunteers theres no way the local government could have got through it without them Theres no wayQ:Did yall have the Texas Navy or the Cajun NavyA:The Cajun Navy showed up I saw them And those guys were a huge helpQ:Were they GoodA:Oh yeah they were a huge help Of course they got some bad press I think and all that but they were a huge help And then just about everybody with a boatQ:And it was like somebody showed up with a boat and it was Heres how you can helpA:Yeah Q:There wasnt credentialing Theres wasnt asking the peopleA:No there wasnt time for that Because if you do that youre just bogging down the process of getting the help Now people ought to have enough sense to if youre bringing a boat make sure its seaworthyQ:Aint it the truthA:YeahQ:I knowA:You know make sure theres life jackets There was so many people out there volunteers that were out there with no life jackets Or there were so many volunteers in boats that you know weand as for communication if youre going back on communication for volunteers youre coming out to help youve got a five-man boat or a six-man boat don't put six volunteers in a boatQ:Of courseA:Okay So then you cant rescue anybodyQ:RightA:And we ran into a lot of that so we were telling these guys Hey if two of yall want to operate the boat or the owner of the boat and an officer or whatever then go out and do it That way you have room in the boat but getting that word out to all the volunteers was pretty difficultQ:I can imagine Well Im hopeful that well be able to share some kind of best practices and some of what we saw happening here in the future with our research and maybe this will help as we move forwardA:Yeah Well I think the best thing is just everybody get out and help Don't sit around and wait for helpQ:Thats right And there was so much of that in the Houston area which Im amazed at the kind of spirit of people who jumped in to helpA:Oh without a doubt It was overwhelming And it wasntnobody cared what party you were associated with or what your color was or your religion Nobody asked that question when you went into rescue No just come on Because you saw the guys that you would point they got a flag flying on the he back of the truck looked like a big redneck racist or something Those guys were out there helping everybodyQ:YeahA:And so I think when it comes down to it people you know human life people just help no matter whatQ:I think that thats rightA:You know when it comes down to itQ:Were there ever language barriersA:Not too much I mean where I was at predominantly its all English There wasnt like a large Hispanic population or Asian Now probably I would say farther south in some of the Asian areas of town that could have been an issue but most of the time we had you know peoplewe dealt with all English-speaking Or you could get the point across you knowQ:I can imagineA:Exactly You could get the point across for help but other than that it was great I mean it was…Q:Well thank you so much I really appreciate your timeEND OF RECORDING [00:45:03]OR_AlfredQ:Do you want us to pick one for youA:I want to be RamboQ:Oh they might identify youA:You all can pick itQ:OkayQ1:Is there a name that youve always wanted to be named or wish you were named Thats always a fun way to startA:I dont think so no I hate my name but I dont know another name that I would  I dont really know another name that I would likeQ:Alright Well come up with something for you So to start things off tell us about  so tell us about your kind of work history in terms of what have you done for how long what your general job kind of roleA:So Ive been with the Houston Police Department for oh man going on 11 yearsQ:Have you reallyA:Yeah May itll be 11 years And started on patrol for about  I did 3 years of patrol night shift patrol And then from night shift patrol I went to a tactical unit which entailed a lot of investigations warrant service  things like that So I did that for about 3 years Then I worked more  lets see  went and worked in the planning division Which planning division does  thats what they do Its exactly what it sounds like So the do a lot of research on how can we respond to code service faster How can we  they plan for if a hurricane were to happen or something were to happen  how do we feed the officers How do we go about doing that So their plan  they had these pods basically filled with supplies So every station got a pod of supplies such as water MREs things like that So that was their whole role From that I left there and I went back to another tactical unit out in the Sharpstone area and thats where Im currently at right nowQ2:You were telling me you were going to do bike squad but then they kind of-A:Yeah I was doing the bike squad and then they canned that So just kind of transitioned into something elseQ:That is interesting So day in day out are you in the same areaA:Mm-hmmQ:So whats the difference between patrol and an investigation unitA:Well so the tactical unit were basically just looking for drugs guns gang members  just high profile  just trying to get anything we can off the streets We saturate an area and find what we can Now if there are like a string of robberies that are going on or burglaries or what not we will sit back and do all the research on it read all the reports see what kind of patterns there are if there are any And once we catch a pattern we work a lot on what we call juggers What they do is theyll basically watch you come  go into a bank and come out and theyll follow you off and wait til a good time to get you So theyll take your money  whatever it is  and they sit there and thats all they do They just watch you Theyll sit in the parking lot Theyll get to the parking lot before the bank even opens and sit and watch and just watch people coming and going If you walk in with a bank bag come out  the bank bag looks a lot fuller than it did when you went it So there was different operations that wed do Wed have an undercover go in with a bank bag and come back out Fill it with receipts and come back out And then we would see who would follow us off And then youd have under- undercover officers following that guy Its a big ring man These people  theyre smart These criminals are not dumb So we do a lot  we do a lot of  a little bit of everything So its a lot of fun A lot of funQ:Wow So share with us how when Hurricane Harvey happened how were yall brought into your unit in particular in your groups  how were you brought in to help with those rescuesA:So basically they  they had already told us we needed to be  like dont plan on going home So they sent us home I packed up everything I needed and what not and then we took off back out to the station Well I guess after the big part  we were watching it on our phones the storm coming in So it was really pounding us and pounding us  they told us dont go anywhere Just stay hunkered down and wait it out Because there was nothing we could do We cant help anybody We dont have boats Were not going to be in a boat in the middle of a hurricane Its just  theres nothing we could do Now the good thing was we didnt really lose power We didnt lose power internet access any of that stuff which was pretty surprising Ive been through one hurricane before and that power was out for a week in my area So I was expecting the same thing Of course iPhones and what not werent  social media wasnt as big as it is now Its really exploded in the past few years But  so we didnt lose any power or anything Then we got the call that  there were people calling in on the actual landline saying Hey we need help getting in and out of here What we did was  we just went to the area We heard it over the radio theres people needing to come out We could hear other officers talking over the radio Hey we need this We need boats Blah blah blah blah I dont know how the public  the public really  I talked to them and they said they were just basically driving around And whenever they could launch their boat they would launch it into an area So thats good and bad because you have guys that would drive from Austin and they would launch their boat And theres nobody out there Theres no communication And what happened is we had already gone and cleared that whole neighborhood out So that was a big problem So we got this one call  this lady who couldnt get out of her house or what not So we haul over there and it is deep  I was going to have to swim through the water to get to her Well come to find out she had already been helped There was a couple who owned an air boat and they went up there they got her and brought her back out I hooked up with them I said Hey how can we get a hold of you Theyre like Were going to be out here all week doing whatever If you guys need help just let us know So we got their personal phone number and exchanged information that way So we would go out the next day and wed be in a different area and wed be like Hey can you come over here So they would come out It would take some time for them to come out because theyd have to find their way through the roads and what not But see what I did  I dealt with a lot of older people So 60s 70s So a lot of them arent very fluid with social media So they didnt use it It was just calls from the phone  9-1-1 But the way we would get ahold of those people with the airboat  we would also get on social media too and you could message them A lot of people too they dont like to give their cell phone number out so you can use insta-messenger through Facebook to get a hold of them You know their name but you dont know their phone number People really are kinda of finicky about that I dont want to give you my phone number but just message me So we would message them as well Can you come over here They would come through But the older generation they dont  they didnt really  they didnt use any of that that I sawQ:Thats great Thats very helpful So when you were called in did you work the neighborhood Did your neighborhood that you normally work  was it floodedA:You know thats so funny because the neighborhood that I usually work is a lot lower income And the people that we were helping were the higher income They were the ones that were all flooded Actually I dont think the lower income where I was at were even flooded I think they were fine So we didnt do any high water rescues over there We did them all in the neighborhood that houses were at And a lot of those were backed up to the bayou So when that bayou was overflowing thats when the calls really started coming in They had nowhere to go And then you had some of them  I dont want to go Leave me alone People that are just stubborn We had one guy who was yelling at me because he said  he said Hey officer I need you to tell that guy to take me on his boat to go to the grocery store I was like I cant tell him that Thats his boat He said Well I got to go to the grocery store Well we can take you out but were not bringing you back in And then you have live electrical boxes  Centerpoint was coming through Hey you guys need to be careful because we couldnt shut of electricity so theres wires around here Im walking through the water like  Crap Ive got this guy yelling at me that he doesnt want to leave and Im treading through this water But like I was telling you last night Academy really helped out So what they did was they basically  I think they dropped that through social media because thats how a buddy of mine was telling me  he read on a post that Academy was going to open their doors to first responders So we went in there and basically got whatever we wanted and it was comped So I had gone the day before and bought some weighters And then they opened the doors and said Hey everythings for free So they gave us a small boat to use And we used that too That was really nice of them Academy really had really stepped up And that too  they used social media to drop that  to put that post out there And a lot of places food related clothes  all that stuff  was all over social media Thats how we found out all this stuff It was like Officers if you guys are hungry were doing a big barbeque at this location Come over here So we would go over there and go eat and then come back It was  I forgot about that A lot of people used it to feed usQ:Thats interesting And were yall just passing that information back and forth from one officerA:Yeah thats how we would get with our  we would relay all that to our supervisors because they actually said Hey if yall find anything thats open  because basically it was like heres these MREs and they were like nasty They were like  Go find your food Its on you So we had to basically scout the area They said Hey if you find somewhere thats feeding everybody let us know and what well do is  and then it would just go up the chain The captain would get with them and say Hey if you have enough food well buy this much from you We need to feed this many officers and these shifts and these hours So they would come in and just bring the food for us It was awesome It was really cool But thats how we got fed I wouldnt have eaten those MREs I was eating Skittles I had a bunch of Skittles I was eating all the candy We were like trading  Ill trade you my Snickers for your SkittlesQ:So were you all trading that information through police radios or was that also through personal networks contacting people you knew and using your phonesA:It was kind of like every station for themselves Once we established the food and everything we kind of just kept it in that general  that station But we would also let the surrounding stations  like Hey if you guys havent eaten we can coordinate it Because our area was really lucky because we had the Galleria area And its  theres nothing but food restaurants  nothing but restaurants And a lot of these restaurants too when the first hurricane came through the restaurants would have like a big barbeque pit and they would just cook the food they had there and theyd feed us because they said Its going to expire anyways Here just come eat it So they would just sit out there all day cooking on the barbeque bits It was really neatQ:So were yall kind of landlocked in terms of  was there water around you Could you get in and out Could you get back to your homesA:No We werent allowed to go home We had to stay  they said Youre not allowed to go home until we tell you further So that  the last time the hurricane came through  a hurricane came through it was 12 hours on 12 hours off And those 12 hours off you could go home So this hurricane was like  and I dont know if it was because the chief was new or  I dont know I dont think hes ever been through something like this Hes from California then Austin Hes  I dont think hes been used to that We were like Oh hurricane Whatever Hey overtime money lets do it But he said nobody go home So we couldnt go home And then it was 12 hours on 12 hours off But there was I think two or three days  two days I think that we were 24 hours So we would actually work and then we would sleep but you were still  when they needed you they would call you and you had to go So we were still on the clock basically But Im losing my train of thought What was the original questionQ:Were you landlockedA:Oh yeah So this hurricane man it was bad We had people going the wrong way on the highways because the highways were closed off They didnt realize so they get to the top and look down and its nothing but water So they were coming the opposite way We had to contain all those people and say Hey look This is Well where do we go Im like I dont know Everything is covered in water You gotta wait til it recedes So a lot of people were getting stuck in their cars too They didnt bring any food and all that So it was very hard to navigate where we were at But gave it about a day or two and it started to recede a little bit and we were able to get  but there were parts  we would relay all the time If we were driving through and we saw an area that was completed flooded or a road that was completely flooded we were relaying that back to dispatch and back to our supervisors So they were mapping out what all was closed what was opened So they would kind of give us routes if we had to go to certain locationsQ:Now when they give you routes they did that verbally right Or were they able to send you pictures in any way so youd have an ideaA:No they wouldnt send us pictures they would just tell us verbally Theyd say Hey this  a lot of times we would have officers blocking those areas too so we kind of knew But they would say Hey this is still flooded Dont go over there And every time a new place opened up where you could drive through they would let us know as well But the department doesnt  we have a social media but we dont really use it for that I dont even know how many people man it because that would be a lot of information to push through during a hurricane and only have one person managing it or a couple Because every station  I mean it would be kind of cool if every station had their own social media account so that you could click right into your station and say  these are the live updates This is whats going on That would have been helpful as well Then you have people that dont use social media Like this oneQ:That is exactly right So other than  so when you all were coordinating and finding out food did you use any other social media platforms other than FacebookA:It was mainly Facebook because you look at Instagram  I dont use Twitter so I dont know  the only thing I use is Facebook and Instagram was mainly pictures and what not so its kind of hard to relay information that way But more  the Facebook is a lot more  its live its updating constantly and tells you  I think thats basically what we use I think a lot of people  the majority of people use FacebookA1:Even in our neighborhood we have a Facebook page and they were constantly letting everybody know in the neighborhood  Walmarts open now The Krogers open Dont go down hereA:Thats true Youre rightQ:Do yall have in addition to your neighborhood Facebook do you have Next Door or any other neighborhood thingsA:We have it but we dont use itQ:Im also interested about that because you were working in an area how many miles  how far away from your homeA:I want to say about 30 miles from home 30 milesQ:So then you didnt How did people deal with the fact that some of them had to have had their houses flooding a long ways away from them And you were probably thinking you had a good chance of yours getting floodedA1:Anton had his house floodedQ:Yeah my buddy So my buddy Anton his whole first floor apartment was completely flooded And we couldnt leave so we couldnt go back to check on it So he was kind of like stressed out the whole time Hes like I dont have a house anymore So then finally when they were like Hey go home Youre allowed to go home He went home and he just went to go look at it He couldnt even get in at first So he went and stayed at his father- and mother-in-laws house Stayed over there And then when he was finally able to get in everything was gone He lost everything But the Department what they did was they gave them I think a day or two to kind of go gather or do whatever you have to do  only the people that had their houses flooded Go take care of what you have to take care of and then report back So  and a lot of them couldnt go like I said until the water receded So that was pretty bad But they helped us out a lot [18:30] came through We got him a free mattress And that was through social media as well My buddy he had posted - _ had posted that and one of the guys on my squad sent the link to him because he doesnt have Facebook Hes in his 40s  doesnt have any of that stuff He saw the link and it was  Come show your ID and whatnot He ended up getting a full king-size bed It was like a 3 or 4 thousand dollar mattress It was a mattress pedic or Macapedic His version of the Tempurpedic So it was a really nice mattress He got that And then the Union helped out as well Thats all over social media as well They helped out with money and what not to help compensate them for all the stuff that they lost  everything they lost A lot of that the donations and what not were all through social media He didnt know anything about it because he didnt have it So we would find it and we were like Hey go check this out and see what you can get or whatever Then you had some people that were posing as officers and trying to get mattresses That was crazy That takes a lot of nerve to go and do that And then again we could have probably charged them with something  impersonating a police officer just going up there trying to get a free mattress Thats pretty cold-heartedQ:Yeah You said the Union Does the Union use social mediaA:Yes they do They use it a lot A lot of their stuff  and now we have a younger president that just came in and hes all social media Everything he posts is on Facebook I think he has Twitter as well He utilizes that a lot Obviously the Chief does too Shes real big on social mediaQ:So is the Union just Harris CountyA:So the Union  its HPOU which is Houston Police Officers Union They are  they just represent Houston police officers They do all their dealings with the city and the chief and all that stuff But they helped us out a lotQ:Thats good Thats really good So what did you see in terms of  I think you had kind of mentioned some when we were talking yesterday about  Could you take pictures while you were either on duty or off duty Could you post thingsA:Yeah we could take pictures and what not I dont like to post things I dont really take any pictures at work and all that Some people do and a lot of people get in trouble for it  they post the wrong thing or theyre just not thinking I took a lot of pictures more for my memories when I get older Im still trying to figure out how to store those or what not But they actually gave us a huge  everybody kind of dumped all their pictures that they took So its on an actual drive through the HPD Like I guess they have their own server So we have all the pictures on there I tried to make a book about it with all these pictures but a lot of people have older phones so the quality  you couldnt even print them out It was  I was made because it took me like an hour and a half to make this whole book online And then after I did it it was like  these are low-quality images Were not going to be able to print thisQ:Ive so been there YesA:Come on people But a majority of it was taken with the phones They would just post up online Look at this or what not I took a lot of pictures and got a lot of pictures  received a lot of pictures from friends and what notQ:Oh wow So we may ask if theres some of those that youd be willing to share with us just for our research because getting the perspective of someone who was working in an official capacity and what they felt like what was important to capture even for your own memories gives us a lot of insight into what a real call for help and a real rescue looks like So that would be very helpful So I guess another question I have is how would you say that this emergency was different Or was it different from other types of emergencies that youve been involved withA:It was different because  its probably the worst storm  it is the worst storm weve ever had Nobody really knew what to expect It was more  watching the storm on your phone you could see where it was going It would just come  it would leave it would go back on land and then it would just come right back And youre like  What the heck This is nuts Once it goes back on the water its building more power more energy and its coming back and just smoking us again It just continued raining and raining and raining I mean we got  we were the only house where the water come up all the way to the back  that back door And it was about to come in I was watching the storm pattern and I could see that it was going to hold up for about 30 minutes to an hour And it sure did Once that happened it all receded We got really lucky It was very different from the first hurricane we had gone through because the flooding The flooding was the biggest issue We were able to get around a lot quicker We were working as hard and as  as much as we did We went  like I said we did go home for a whole week So that affects you in different ways because a lot of people get homesick or theyre worried about their families and theyre all stressed out And then now you have to go to work You have to workA1:That was also when like you couldnt go to the first doctors appointmentA:Yeah I missed the ultrasound That was for the heartbeat rightA1:Yeah I was so upset But my neighbor luckily she went with me because they had to cancel my appointment I was like Is there any way you can come home to see this He was like No I cant come homeA:So I missed that I missed the first one And then  but you have the picture rightA1:Yeah we took a video of itA:Yeah they took a video of it She texted me the picture and what not It was  it was different like I said because the biggest thing was not being able to go home And so A1:And also like an officer diedA:Yeah An officer he drowned trying to get to the station He got caught up in all the water and what not But yeah it was  the last one we had it was kind of like  the worst thing with that was the power So what happened was the community  you go to the lower income and theyre like You guys dont care about us Yall have our power shut off Were the last people to get our power and its yalls fault Im like Im not an electrician I dont deal with any of the  I dont work for Centerpoint I work for Houston Police Department I dont know what you want me to do So the community was really like on edge that they were out of power for a week A lot of people dont realize how important electricity is When thats down everythings down So they were really upset This time around Im telling you we could not have done what we did without the community The community just came in and it was crazy reading all the stories People coming from other states to help out That was really interesting I 100% give it to the community Theyre the ones that helped us out Theyre the reason we were able to do what we did especially with their boatsA1:It got to a point where  because I remember my friend and I we were just stuck here We were like  lets see where we can volunteer We called up people at the Mattress Mac or Gallery Furniture and they were turning volunteers away because they were like We have way too many people Through my school district they had three school locations  it was like two high schools and an elementary school and they sent out a Google document for  like you could take shifts because there were so many people that went there And again they were turning people away They were turning supplies away because they just had an overflow of supplies We ended up  actually the brewery that you were at yesterday we ended up going over there because they had  it was just overwhelming like how much stuff to go through that people just kept dropping off And then we would take them to churches and things like thatA:Katy Mills right here was a big drop-off location They were staged up over thereQ:And this was for people who needed suppliesA:YesQ:So it was kind of a makeshift shelter but you didnt stay there You just went there for suppliesA1:Yeah people would go drop off supplies there and then we had volunteers that were sorting things And then youd have people come pick it up and call and be like What do you guys need Do you need diapers Do you need clothes Do you need food Do you need animal suppliesA:Yeah so that was basically the hub and then they would transport it to churches or whoever were donating all the stuff out So they would take it there sort it all out and then transport it to where it needed to go And then the people would come and grab and take what they neededA1:Yeah it was just so crazy because we kept calling places and theyre like We dont need any more people No more donations Were like What What can we do There were just so many peopleA:We had everything Dog food I mean everything Im telling you it was something Id never seen beforeQ:So the community also came through in terms of rescues rightA:Yeah We didnt  actually I dont even know if we have boats except for the ones that they use to patrol on Lake  on the lake Which I dont understand because this is going to become the norm This is not going away This is  youre going to start getting hurricanes that are going to start topping each other And if we went through what we did this time I mean theres no way that we can function without boatsQ:So how did the different groups  it seems to me like there should be some group official group that has boats that could have collaborated So share with me some about other groups Like was the National Guard working with you Was the Texas Guard working with you Was fire and rescue Were there other peopleA:Who was it that was out there I cant remember them but these guys this is all the did was high water rescues They were in full wetsuits and had helmets on They were really good at what they did very efficient They would take their boat They would go in They were even bringing stretchers and what not to load those people on They were really good I cant remember what group that was or who it was But it wasnt Fire Department It wasnt us But we did have the Coast Guard come out They came out airlifted somebody So in the house I think we had  there was a  I think she was a paraplegic older lady So they loaded her up on a board And the helicopter was just hovering there And they lifted her up took her up there and the helicopter was out I saw that  I saw Coast Guard a couple of times doing that So that was really cool I mean you have somebody who has that kind of injury or that kind of condition and then putting them on a boat and rocking everywhere The crazy thing is  like I said the community stepped up because we had another lady that was  I think she was  I think she was paralyzed as well She was an older lady So we took her through the air boat The air boat was really smooth We had to load her up in the back of a Tahoe The civilian took her to the hospital HFD wasnt even there I dont know  maybe there were on another side of town or what happened with all that But Im telling you the community is the one that stepped up for usQ:So it sounds like there wasnt a lot of collaboration between the different official organizations just across the board It was whoever happened to be in the area whoever happened to show up was thereA:Right Which causes a lot of disorder Youre relaying over the radio These people are in this house These people are here And then we get them cleared out and then you have more people coming with these boats Were going to go in there Were like We already went there It was  it was hard to relay that information that these neighborhoods had already been cleared out So we started just putting banners on the doors that told us what house we had already been toQ:So in addition to that  that sounds like that was probably a communication problem/challenge  what other kind of problems with communication did you seeA:I mean a lot of it too with the officers as well  we would go in and we didnt know that theres  theres no way to  same thing Wed have people that would go in  officers that were clearing out  and then one person wanted to stay back so they would stay And then they would call in an hour later and want us to go back in So a different group would go back in The original group was probably somewhere else So we would go and they were like  supervisors would say Hey go and check the rest of the houses So we would go through all the houses and we didnt know that people had already been cleared out of there We didnt know how many people were still left there We didnt know any of it We didnt have hard numbers Like I said the made it a little bit difficult for us when the people were like Were going to stay And then they realized  Oh crap The waters coming in even more Now we need you Its like now we cant get out to you because the boats that we used were  they were privately owned boats Theyve gone  they left They went out They cleared that area out and now theyre on the other side of town or theyre helping somewhere else in the area We cant get to you anymore A lot of people thought it was a taxi service It wasnt you need to come out If youre going to stay there were letting you know that were not going to be back We dont have  going back to the original problem we dont have our own boats to just say dispatch a boat out thereQ:And are yall trained in this type of situationA:I didnt get any of this stuff None of it The Fire Department from what I hear is trained But were not Absolutely notQ:But they needed you and so they pulled you in is what it sounds like rightA:Yeah Basically it was like Hey get on a boat and go help out as much as you can So thats what we didQ:Thats so interestingA:It was  and it was voluntary too They didnt say You have to go It was just kind of whoever wanted to go get in the water goQ:Cool That is interesting So what have yall noticed that Ive missed Ive kind of gone through our main questionsQ1:The higher ups did they give you any guidelines for like interacting with the boat owners Or was it just make it happenA:No make it happen and wherever you can get Just bring it overQ1:Did all the boats have an officer on them or were there some-A:There were some that were operating without an officer It was nice to have an officer on them because it kind of tells people  Hey lets go Some people are like  Im not listening to you I dont know who you areQ2:Yall probably know the area better because a lot of people probably-A:Yeah and thats true A lot of people from out of town theyve never been on this side of town We had to navigate them through let them know  go down this road This is flooded So it was very beneficial to have an officer on the boatQ1:And you said you contacted them a lot through Facebook instant messenger because they didnt want to give their phone number out Was that just your personal FacebookA:Yeah that was my personal FacebookQ1:Is it fair to say without a Facebook account you wouldnt have been able to get that air boatA:Yeah If they wouldnt have given me a phone number yes it would have been I mean Facebook was the only way to get a hold of themQ1:Do you have a  I mean is your  I guess youve got a smart phone Is it paid for by the departmentA:No Its our own phoneQ1:Is that something you normally use in day to dayA:Oh yeah Its our own phoneQ1:So its pretty common to do thatA:Yeah I mean actually I fell off the boat and my phone got destroyed And took it to Apple and they gave me a free oneQ:Did they reallyA:They were like Here dont worry about it We got you covered Man that was really coolQ:That is really coolA:It was like a six seven hundred dollar phone The new ones are water proof and that one wasnt I took it to them I was like Hey I was at work and this this and this They were like Okay let me see what I can do They came back and was like Hey manager said dont worry about it I was like that was really cool Because I didnt have insuranceQ:You dont really imagine being out in pouring down water and boatsA:No And I even put it in a plastic bag you know just in case And a lot of times I was like Im not bringing my phone but you need it What if your radio gets destroyed gets thrown in the water whatever and you cant communicate with people Youve got to get on the phone and call somebody So you definitely need your phone Its become a necessityQ:Absolutely That just makes such senseQ1:You have a new friendA:Oh yeahQ:You do Thats pretty funny So I am curious What kind of other questions what kind of things should we have asked that you think might be helpful since you kind of know what were trying to do with our researchA:I think yall pretty much hit everything The biggest thing  the biggest issue out there I think was communication That was the biggest part Like I said it was just overlapping Everything was just overlapping Wed go into an area clean it out And then  I mean we would know by the banners that we would put on the doors what that meant But there was no way to give that information out to the outside world and let them know Hey this is whats going on in this area and this is what this stands for A lot of people didnt knowQ:Have yall been trained in marking houses when you evacuate them with spray paint Are you even aware that thats kind of a standard procedureA:NoQ:Thats interestingA:And you would think in a city that floods more than once a year would have some kind of standard as far as flooding or hurricane  big storms We get them all the timeQ:Thats interesting And I dont know what standard that is I dont know if its FEMAQ1:I think its FEMAQ:I think it is a FEMA standard Yall probably  have you even been through any FEMA trainingA:None of that The department is just very  its in an old-school way I tell them all the time  when I worked for planning I was like Hey can we do this Can we do that Theyre like I dont know about all that I mean I think like drones would have really helped outQ:Tell us how you think they would have helped outA:Well once it stopped raining  obviously youd have to wait until the rain stops  you could easily navigate one over a neighborhood and see whats going on how the area looks what streets are flooded where a boat can navigate And all thats live and can be updated  relayed through the radio Or a boat  lets see we had boats getting stuck out there because they were getting caught on the concrete So  because the water  and thats why the air boats helped out a lot because those air boats can fly on about an inch of water Thats all they need But some of these guys  we had two jet skis that burnt up out there because they got caught up on the streets and they burned up the motors So now youve got to go get those people out And how do you even know How do we even know where theyre at or whats going on with them because theyre not part of the police department Theyre just civilians out there So now youre going to save the people that were trying to save people or help out The drones easily would have kind of helped out a lot Or go into an area and go Hey do we need to go over there or do we not need to go over there And just give us an aerial picture That is big too because when were driving  a lot of people just fall right in the water They dont realize that the water is so high because the road goes down or whatnot But we could easily throw a drone out there and relay any information thats needed A lot of it I think would have  a lot of that would have been beneficial knowing what roads are flooded and where it opens back up and how to navigate in thereQ:That makes a lot of sense So the drones  do you see any reason that drones would help in training of officers Or is it more information gathering during an eventA:Yeah I think it would be more informational  more information gathering Maybe  no Maybe how to  because obviously you have Google Maps and you can do those aerial views But it looks way different when a road is flooded So if you were to throw a drone up there You can tell where the road stops and where the water is and then where it opens back up too I would think training officers on how to decipher what a flooding  what a flooded area looks like from an aerial view I think would be pretty good trainingQ:Okay Thats really helpfulQ1:Any other things you think could be useful just in terms of communication for the next disaster thats gonna hitA:I dont know Maybe coming up with an actual  and I dont know if we have one or not Its obviously above my pay grade But having an actual plan in place for a hurricane or a natural disaster I know we had some stuff that was working with the Pods and all that  they were ready to go with all that But the  as far as  I dont know I just think better communication Being more efficient Because I dont think we were very efficient at allQ:Efficiency is-A:Efficiency was a big  like I said you got boats that went in there and then other boats coming back doing the same thing Theres no way to relay that information to those peopleQ:Thats interesting So the last thing I wanted to do is if you could do me a favor and just quickly  theres just four little demographic questions If you could just check those for us that would be helpful This has really been helpful This is incredibly helpfulA1:I was thinking when you were saying that I was like man you just got a good story to tellQ:Absolutely And its just so complex tooA:Yeah theres a lot of moving parts to that I dont have the answer but I think if they would have  I think if the department would poll officers that actually were out there doing it and gather their information and how we could be more efficient I think that would be beneficial to the department as a whole But I dont know if theyd do thatQ:Well you know theres a chance that what I could do is suggest us coming and doing some focus groups to learn what were the best practices and then to feed that back into planning I think that would be incredibly beneficialA:Thats only my story on my side of town I dont know what was going on on the other  I have no idea what was going on on the other side of town what problems they experienced Im just a small portion of what happenedQ:So do you have some of the images on your phoneA:Yeah Could you get my iPad babe Its in the Q:That would be great because what we could do is we have our dedicated project phone and we could have you maybe airdrop  use airdrop and send our project phone some of those images That would be really helpfulCHAT RE CLEANUP AND DISHWASHERSA:Did you want me to airdrop these to youQ1:Yeah that would be  whatever pictures youre comfortable with We should be able to connect if your Bluetooth  you should see us come up as an optionQ:Itll say something like NSFHR I think Harvey ResearchA1:Oh yeah whats so funny he had a friend that works for  I think its like Mustang or Cat  like the trucks the big trucks And he came out there with like a dump truck or something like that And we just saw him with this big truck and he was like Hey thats Donnie What was it He was like getting-Q:Did he have people in itA1:Did heA:Yeah we were transporting people in and out of the neighborhood with that Actually I have a video of it I can send youQ:That would be really helpful because weve heard stories of this but we dont have an image of what that looks like And it makes complete sense that you would do thatA:Yeah its pretty cool Let me see Ill send you more from my phoneQ1:So did you guys here about the Cajun Navy at allA:Oh yeah yeah We actually ran into a couple of them That was really cool They were-A1:The Cajun NavyA:Yeah They were out there with their boatsQ1:What was the kind of perception around their efforts Was it organized or kind of-A:Yeah they  I didnt work with them very much I had just heard about them And I heard about them through social media They were out there I didnt really even know what the Cajun Navy were until this all happened I dont know how organized they were or what but it was pretty cool to see them coming in and help outA1:What are theyQ1:Its a bunch of  a lot of them are from Louisiana Theres actually several different groups that kind of call themselves the Cajun Navy But theyre gator hunters and fishers that own either shallow water boats or air boats And when floods happen theyll go to the flooded area and start doing rescues and things like thatA:Got it Theres some videos on there tooA1:Oh the one with DonnieA:I have it on my phone right hereQ1:Any last thoughts on a pseudonym or a nameA:I dont knowQ1:Caroline do you have a nameA1:I dont knowQ1:Some people are funny about itA1:Oh reallyQ1:Theyre like  oh I wish I was named this or that I didnt get to name my kid this but this is the nickname or something like thatA:This is that big dump truck I was telling yall aboutQ1:Oh thats a big dump truckA:Yeah its one of those huge industrialA1:Was Donnie driving it or was he just on itA:He was just in the backQ1:How did they even get that over thereA:Drove itQ1:Its like a big  its a legitimate dump truckQ:I mean it makes sense It can handle this And there are people in itA:Yeah they were in the  well on the side There were a couple on the back where the back portion of it  we were on the sideA1:It was just so crazy that you happened to know him You were like Hey thats DonnieA:He called me and I was like Hey whats up He goes Hey Im in the big dump truck Because what happened was we got transported through via boat and the boat had to stop because there was no more water on that street So then we were going to have to walk all the way to this house  we were going to have to swim And so at that point we saw the dump truck My buddy called me and said Im in the dump truck I was like Dude let me get in So we jumped in and he took us out to this ladys house And then we had to get a canoe  were lucky that the neighbor had canoes because there was no way  it was probably at least 15-18 feet deep So we took a boat to get there Then we had to get on a dump truck to go And then after the dump truck we had to get on a canoe to canoe to this ladys house Thats the thing its-A1:Is that when you fell in the waterA:Thats when I feel in the water on the canoeA1:He had to go to the hospitalA:Yeah Its such a dynamic situation because theres not one tool that would have fixed this whole problem I had to take a boat Then I had to get on a dump truck And then I had to get on a canoe to get to that lady And a boat-A1:And by the time you get there shes like I want to stayA:Shes like I want to stay or I dont want to go or Im packing all my stuff up right now Come back in 30 minutes Im like Do you just realize what I had to do to come over here And then we had-A1:Like Private RyanA:Yeah and we had to be nice to them Im just kind of like Lady Im working on not going home for four days and you want me to come back in 30 minutes No its not going to happen Its not a taxi serviceQ:That is great Whats really cool is we have that same story from people who were rescueds perspective And now we kind of have both sides And that is so cool because it is  I dont think  I think most people would not get the fact that because the water level fluctuates it takes different tools to make it through the different  and then there are places that are high enough where theres no water And its  its really dynamic Its so interesting to think about it from that perspective Yall thank you so much This has been wonderful I appreciate all your timeA1:Im glad you had the chance to come outA:Thanks for coming outQ:AbsolutelyQ1:And now we know to add Uncle Julios two-hour thing at the restaurantQ:That was awesomeEND OF RECORDINGOR_KelliQ:So a couple of the key things that Ill also point out to you is because were trying to get peoples private social media data I always want to make sure that they know that we actually  I have a dedicated phone to send Its only used for the project And when they want  I have to even buy the plan every month so we protect theirs as much as we physically canA:OkayQ:So I would love if you would start and share with me how did you decide to get involved in the rescue effortM:The blood sacrificeQ:Thats what it is Thats what it isA:I live in Old Katy Our street happened to be flooded My house did not get flooded but the water had come up and over  flooded the rest of my neighborhood And the boats came in to rescue some of the people down there And I did not know at that time that the National Guard was there We just knew that Katy was pretty much flooded and we were stuck in there I received a phone call because the National Guard had come in I received a phone call from a friend of mine who is the president of the Katy Athletic Booster Club And I also am on Katy Athletic Booster Club And she said Carrie the National Guard is here and theyre trying themselves to get food but they cannot do this and try to do what theyre doing She said If anybody can do this you can do this She said Is there any way you can come up here I said Well sure Ill come up there And Im thinking a day or two I wasnt thinking seven days And they were at our high school  my daughter was at Katy High School at the time So I was comfortable with being there And I walked in and they basically said Here you go and handed me a pad and said do what you can do And thats just kind of how it started It just kind of snow-balled Really snow-balled Where everyone was just calling me and wanting to know what they could do Oh we have people over here that need to be helped What can you do And Oh we have people in Brazoria Texas How can you help them It was like okay Thats just kind of how it happenedQ:Wow So you became the logistics person essentially at the high schoolA:I did I answered to Sergeant-Major LaMonica personally And he would come to me every morning let me know how many people were there how many men I was feeding who was coming in who was not And he would just say Do what you can do And it would start at 8:00 every morning and I was finished at 5:00 every afternoon And then we started to realize that the guys that were there they needed  when they were going out on these missions they had nothing No sunscreen no  they just  Im sure that they provided it for them but we  travel size and stuff like that So I put out a Facebook thing and said Okay Katy This is what I need And the people that showed up just with travel-sized this that  Do you need feminine products Do you need this Do you need that And we would sit and make baggies when they would get ready to go out at night on their missions And they would say I have 11 guys Can you make 11 baggies for me This is what I need  hand sanitizer I need anti-bacterial I need Band-aids I think a lot of that was for people that they were rescuing They probably gave that away Im thinking that they didnt tell me that but Im assuming that thats what they were doing Because thats what they were there for was to take care of other people So we just  I have lots of picturesQ:That would be really helpful Thats incredibly helpfulA:Can I share them with youQ:You sure may Please open  we actually find that a lot of times that people show us and talk through the pictures Its actually a wonderful way for us to learn more And then anything that you want to screen shot and can actually textQ1:Yeah any pictures that you just want to share if you want to share them with usQ:We can take them in multiple waysA:This was my street That was when the boat  it was an air boat that came We live on the very end of this street where the Morton Road is a main thoroughfare We live right  were the first lot So everything down south of us flooded So they were going down there rescuing people and stopping in our front yard Thats just a video of him coming in This was our high school  behind the high school The soccer fields are here Back behind here is the baseball field Our baseball field was  our concession stand was totally destroyed And theyve recently done it Thats what the back parking lot  thats where the kids usually park to go The water amazingly did not get in the school at all This was just the parking lotQ:It looks like a river A lakeA:I know doesnt it But nothing got into the schoolQ:Wow Thats just amazingA:This is down the street from the school Theres a McDonalds  this is a four-way stop when you get off the freeway and the McDonalds and the Shell  all that flooded You could not pass that That was 1463 This is 1463 And that was completely impassable Those are the buses that are at  were at Legacy Stadium We were basically the only place that they could come There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of buses that were going in and picking people up and then taking them to sheltersQ:I dont have any pictures of the buses Ive heard people talk about themA:Yes Hundreds of them I mean I couldnt even get pictures and they would sit there for days and just wait for them to be calledQ1:WowA:To say This is where we need you to go They were coming from Louisi  they were coming from everywhere So thats where they were at That was the  oops  that was the parking lot Oh hold on Im sorryQ1:Weve heard so many stories about people getting rescued and getting dropped off and not being sure what to do nextQ:And then when they take them to places like Austin the people in Austin talk about the fact that there was no return plannedA:There wasnt But what they were trying to do was just get them out of thereQ:Get them to safetyA:Get them to safety somehow So these buses were  and I just happened to be driving by and Im like Dang what are all those buses there for And so I took pictures And then later they were saying it I was like Oh my gosh thats what that was This is just a little video of stuff I would put videos on Facebook for Katy and say Look what yall have done Look I put the call out Look what youve doneQ:So it was the way to thank people and to reward themA:This was just a little bit  we had a snack bar set up for the soldiers And when they would get up or go out we told them You can grab whatever you want This is your commissary They would say What do we owe you Nothing This is all for you And so they would pick and choose what they wanted to take They would take it out This is some of the stuff that they brought We just asked for anything This  one guy asked for a pillow And so he had a pillow and they all started saying Whered you get your pillow Can we have a pillow And so I put a Facebook post out and said Can yall please bring pillows And the pillows poured Hundreds of pillows And thats the first thing they would go to when they would come into the foyer of the high school It was like Wheres the pillows They wanted a pillowQ:They wanted a good nights sleep because of the workA:Well you know what Because a lot of them would go out and they would be out for a couple of days and sleep and all they wanted was a pillow while they were out Its not while they were there Its while they were out These are just some of the buckets Our Ziploc bags We tried to separate everything  all the candy all the shampoos all the deodorants And then they could just go through and pick and choose as they needed This is just more stuff that we had For seven days people brought this in It wasnt just one or two days It was seven days We would just have cars lined up just deliveringQ:And so how many National Guard do you think came through to get thingsA:I know at one time he told me there were about 1600 there That was like the second day But then at one time there were more that were coming through And it was just kind of a stop off before they went through They didnt all but they would hear that it was here and so they would come through and they were very kind They would say Can I They would never take just advantage We would tell them Take what you need We had churches around that were bringing stuff We had the Lions Club that Ralph  was it the Lions Club I think it was  one of those that would bring stuff We had a little lady who had a group that made quilts and afghans And she was like Can we bring these Well we didnt need those But you know what I can find you somebody that does So I would get on social media and I would put it out there Who needs this This is just some more of things  water  I cannot tell you how much water So when they would go out on their missions in their boats and everything they would grab a couple of cases of water to take with them because they had no drinking water And a lot of them were going downtown where they had the big shelters They were just out there guarding making sure there was no chaos And they didnt have access so we would give them cases of water to take with them And then had that Bug spray This  these are just some of the boats that were out there that they would take out at night when they would go rescue people A lot of their stuff was behind the school This is a group  they were kind of higher ups but these were some people who came in to deliver stuff They all wanted pictures with some of the soldiers just to show that they had had And they were more than obliged These were some of the guys that just happened to be hanging out picking some stuff up Can you take a picture Yes These are some of the volunteers We were very particular about who we asked to volunteer because we did not want people who were going to come in and just  number one not do work But number two we didnt want it out there Katy High School became a military base Part of my job was not to let any civilians in And we had several people come in to try to take pictures We had to get them out They didnt have time to deal with that That was my job to deal with that And I dont have a problem telling people noQ:You just jumped in and took this job onA:I was told what to do what they needed and here you go Do it At first I thought  How am I going to do this I dont know how Im going to do this But we figured it outQ:What do you do  what all have you done in your life in terms of jobs and careersA:I am a stay-at-home momQ:Well youve done a lot thenA:I have a special needs child Shes 19 I help with KABC I volunteer  Im on the Board I just kind of help where Im needed Its funny because I think two weeks before the hurricane Ms Texas United States is a Katy ISD police officer for Katy ISD She had just been to a big pageant had come in second place We had told her we would do a fundraiser for her to help her offset her costs And so it kind of got put in my lap  Okay you do the food And it was so weird because two weeks prior to that I had called around and had gotten people to donate And two weeks later this happened And it was like  Okay This is really weird but I had my  I guess that was my experience I dont know what that is Here is our chow lineQ:Oh wowA:This is just part It literally wrapped around our cafeteria When they heard that chow was there that the restaurants had come they would show up by the droves And the restaurants would cook anywhere from 200  for 200 people Some of them cooked for 500 peopleQ:And would you just put a call out on social mediaA:I would put a call out on social media and I would say Who can help me I had one lady  Treavor Thorson  she works for BBs Café which is in Houston and its here in Katy She was one of the first that said What can I do And she wanted to do Gumbo because theyre a Louisiana restaurant I said Okay Im thinking  Sure what are you going to do Feed 50 people She said Can you get me a propane tank because Im bringing a Gumbo pot I said Okay So I went to Katy Propane said I needed propane He goes  he gave me a propane tank He said Just bring it back when youre done Got the propane tank They ended up bringing 300 meals that first time It was Gumbo was what it was They went crazy They said Anything you need you call me Called her again within that seven day period She said Were on it Came again 300 meals Just whatever  see the line goes all the way aroundQ:Oh my gosh This is incredible We havent had anybody tell us how the Guard  how these people were taken care ofA:They had MREs But they didnt want their MREs when we were bringing food inQ:Of course notA:Theres more of the line We had another snack table set up in there so the guys who werent able to go through there could just go through whenever they wanted a snack It was there for them whenever they wanted it Some of them were in the back of our school  back where the locker rooms were  keeping diaries of kind of what they were experiencing every day Ill have to show you  how long are you going to be hereQ:Ill be here actually through TuesdayA:Okay Im going to bring back the thank you sign they made for us Its a massive thank you sign that they took the time to make and signed it-Q:Ill take a pictureA:Yes You are more than welcomeQ:So Ill be here tomorrow afternoon between 2-5A:Ill come back tomorrow afternoonQ:Thats pretty awesomeA:Theres more of the line I mean I couldnt possibly get them all in it This little girl  her house was flooded and totally destroyed She was at her grandmas house and told her grandma she wanted to do something for them So they baked cookies And they brought up there When the soldiers found out they just all wanted to take pictures with her She was a sweetheart There she is again They let her wear their jackets and everything It was pretty cool This is when they came to Buc-eesQ:Oh my gosh thats just amazingA:When they came from wherever Buc-ees had not opened yet in Katy And they told them You come in and get what you need And this was them parked outside of Buc-ees right before they got to Katy This is one of the Mess Hall staff That pot of Gumbo was probably this tall She had to stand on the chair to dip down in there Those two fed a thousand people Those two pots fed a thousand This was a local restaurant in Katy  Agave Rio  that did that And again it was just me reaching out to them on social media saying What can you do And she said this particular lady that owns this said You tell me what you need Ill do it I said I need for a thousand She said Done And that was itQ:Oh my gosh Thats incredibleA:This is  when they were leaving and I think theres a  I dont know who  theres a Senator or somebody in there  but anyways they all wanted to take a picture This was back in the Command Center in the middle of the high school They had  our little library  it was in the library  our little library was turned into a very private  because its in the center of the school  and only the colonel and the higher ups were allowed in there They had all their computers set up They could see where everything wasQ:Do you think they knew that this was going to be their location before they showed up How did they figure outA:From what I understand they put a call out If you remember or if you know the high school Cinco Ranch got it bad But Cinco Ranch High School was not flooded And neither was Morton Ranch High School And those two high schools were made shelters for the public Once we realized Cinco Ranch community had been flooded we were really the only place we could get to Once you got to Katy everything east of us was flooded They couldnt get anywhere So they got in contact with the principal and he said Come on Were here The school is yours It was funny because we were supposed to have our very first football game September 1st against Austin Westlake and we werent able to have it And they were quite upset because they felt as if Oh because were here and were like no Schools not even in session We cant play a football game if school is not in session We had had special coins made for that inaugural thing And so we coined some of them and said Here This may not be big to you but its big to us It had the date on it It had everything And so we gave it to them What was really cool was the Senator from Massachusetts showed up and he asked me Well who are you I was in the process of  and one of the officers was standing there and was telling him About 30 minutes later this officer came over and he coined me He said Here this is from the Texas National Guard and gave me a coin I was in the process of talking to this man and Im sitting here trying to listen to this man and be focused and listen to him He takes my hand and hes  I dont even remember what he said But whatever they say And he put it in my hand And the guy standing there he starts tearing up because Do you know what just happened to you I said Kind of but Im trying to listen to him Im trying to be attentive to you These are the Blackhawks that would land behind our high school They were all on the football field behind us They would wait for a call and then take off My cousin was one of the Blackhawk pilots  she was there Her home that she grew up in was in Seely and she happened to fly over it and the whole thing was just covered in water  her childhood home But yeah they were back there for seven days They were back there and it was take off land take off land Whenever they told them to go they went This is them loading up the trucks They were getting ready to leave on a mission And they said We need water And all out here was piled  we said Take what you need If we need more well put out another call to social media and well see what we get And so they were out there They formed their line This is just  this is a youth pastor I think from Second Baptist Church He brought 500 meals  at Second Baptist they were just cooking Volunteers were coming cooking I put out a call to him and he said Well get it taken care of This is the whole group This is the colonel These are all the volunteers in red And all the people who were back in the command center  the colonel the sergeant-major everybody that was thereQ:I love the high school sign in the backgroundA:This is LaMonica  the one that I answered to directly This is Colonel McCloud He came to our Katy Athletic Booster Club meeting and just told us how thankful he was that we had been there and just wanted to share his appreciation He said he was raised in Sugarland He said I have never in my life seen a community that has been affected by a hurricane respond like you people have responded He said You know I grew up in Sugarland but I just think I may retire in Katy one day We had a good laugh about that because we know its not true Hes not going to retire Hes a very humble manQ:Thats goodA:This is the New York Fire Department They were at Academy My daughter has an affinity with New York for some reason Shes always wanted to go and weve never been able to One of the people that I got in touch with was the lady who was the liaison for Academy to take care of their troops also When I found out that the New York Fire Department was there I told her about my daughter and said Can we come And they welcomed her with open arms And gave her the grand tour of everything These are two of the guys This guy right here he was in a Sesame Street  in a book with Elmo about the New York Fire Department They were just awesome We gave them a Katy Tiger flag to remember us by This is just another picture of a line at another timeQ:So what hours did you work while you were thereA:8:00 am to 5:00 pm And if they needed me longer I stayed longer I did what I needed to And at the end of the day I had breakfast  not breakfast lunch  they had a contract with a restaurant to provide breakfast for them Lunch and dinner and everything in between were mine And so I would get there at 8:00 in the morning and immediately began calling people for the next day because I needed everything  we had Red Lobster We had Carrabas We had Double Daves SmashBurger Pizza Hut Ive got a list of all the restaurants because the school wanted to write them and thank them personally Just people once they found out we were here after I had tried to get the word out as best I could they began to call me and say  Red Lobster provided chicken alfredo with biscuits and salad and they brought each of them in individual containers and provided for 400 people He did that twice Carrabas came from Houston and provided for 400 people SmashBurger  and we would have not just one restaurant at a time I would have two or three deliver at lunch Two or three because youre looking at between 1500 and 2000 people that could possibly be there at a timeQ:Thats just incredibleA:These are some of the DPS officers that were there These were some of the guys that would go out at night in their boats We would see them come in and they had water lines on their uniforms up to here We had a group of volunteers that was back in our training room where our athletes get their uniforms washed and all they were doing was washing uniforms all the time The guys would come in put their name on their uniform and our moms would wash uniforms dry them fold them have them ready for them that nightQ:I just cant believe that yall spontaneously put this all together Im also a bit appalled that they didnt  they dont have a system in placeA:I think they did but I dont think anybody knew that it was this big that Harvey  because this was just at the beginningQ:Youre right And it was A:They didnt know how badQ:Thats rightA:There was a picture that was circulated from CNN of  this is one of the task forces that was there They took a picture in our bleachers There was a picture that was circulated and got to CNN Before I had got there someone had gotten in The National Guard had just gotten there They were all laying  and you may have seen the picture  in the hallway And CNN was saying  I cant believe they treat our National Guard like this And LaMonica came to me one day and he said Please do not let anyone in here to take any more I said Wont happen at least not while Im here it wont He said You cannot believe what this has done These are soldiers Theyre used to sleeping on the ground This is what they do So sleeping on carpet in a high school is really nice compared to sleeping out there They had MREs They had things they needed But I dont think anybody knew really how big this was and how badQ:And how long it was going to takeA:And how long because once they left our school they went to Beaumont They did not leave and go home They went to Beaumont And they were going  because if you remember Beaumont had no drinking water We sent them with truckloads of drinking water to take with them The helicopters were flying our stuff taking stuff that wherever the military could get it and taking it to Beaumont Thats Dan Patrick So it was just  I got some other  Ill have to send you some of my text messagesQ:That would be great tooA:Just sending out saying What can you do to helpQ:That would be helpful Any of those posts that you made on Facebook to request it would be great to see what a real request looks like especially since it got such a phenomenal response Im still just amazed that people stepped up like they didA:I would put pictures out to tell people  This is what I was privileged to be part of the week that I was at Katy High School because I just wanted them to knowQ:Do you know how to do screen shots on that iPhoneA:I doQ:If you open that one  we also have  we can do AirDrop straight to our project phoneA:Im still learning AirDropQ:Okay Im not too savvy with it either but thats why I have these two people because theyre savvy They know this stuff so they can help us do thisA:Heres one of the things I said Again I am humbled by the generosity of people from all around We put out the call and they came Fifty of the National Guard went out tonight and they needed kits because they were going where there was no running water no drinking water Fifty baggies were made up with all kinds of things that they would need tonight Because of your donations we were able to do this for them and they were able to take water with them Thank you Katy Thank you Texas I just wanted to keep them updatedQ:Thats greatA:Just telling them  My heart is full at seeing how my community has responded From everywhere people came Pillows lotion bug spray I would just  I just wanted to thank them I also have private messages Heres one This was funny I need to get face cream These female National Guards are dying with dry skin Please get it to me You cannot believe the amount People were coming with Mary Kay wanting to know what I needed All I had to do was put it on Facebook and they cameQ:See I havent seen anything like thisA:Im not a person who has a ton of people but I put it public and they were coming What kind of face cream This person goes  Will this work What do you need Theres a lot of travel sized lotions I can get them One lady said  Anything else One lady showed up with Mary Kay She was a distributor and came with a huge box of Mary Kay One lady said  Do you need toiletries I said  feminine products I said just bring them by And people would just comeQ:A lot of the stores were closed especially in the area where they were workingA:So then I said  Katy you have answered with a vengeance to the call for help Thank you so much Well keep you updated on needs At that time the shelters had just opened So people were saying  we were turning people away at one time I said  to the shelters Take it to the shelters because they need So we were told to  people wanted to bring homemade food We could not take homemade food It had to be restaurant quality because you just dont know who wants to hurt the military And so when they would come with the food I was like Take it to the shelters Thats the only thing I knew to do And the shelters would take it Because at that time people were just coming in once there was a shelter I have private messages that I will where I was communicating with the restaurant ownersQ:That would be really helpful I havent gotten to see anything like thatA:Just trying to let them know Did he tell you the story about Brazoria Texas RalphQ:He mentioned that there was a fire station that got trapped or somethingA:There was Somehow my name got to that fire station and they contacted me And they said We need help I said Im in Katy They said We hear that you have been putting the call out I went to Sergeant-Major LaMonica and this was the last day they were there I said I dont know what to do He said Im going to tell you what Im going to do He said Because you have provided for our soldiers he said Im going to give you the MREs they didnt eat He said But youve got to find somebody to get them out there And so I contacted Ralph and he found someone to take them out They had to come from a boat They were completely surround by water in Brazoria They came through their boat met them as far as they could took what supplies they could came back took what supplies they could He gave me 25 pallets of MREsQ:25 palletsA:What they did not eat Because the whole community had nothing It wasnt just the fire station It was the whole community These people had gotten what they could but when they were still stuck and their food was gone they were looking at the little volunteer fire department And he said Weve got Vienna sausages and raviolis But Ill go through my stuff and kind of just share some of them with youQ:That would be wonderful And you can either send them straight to our phone Or on the other side is my email And you can email them Whatever is most convenient for you will work Were actually going to be pulling images this weekend So if you have time to go ahead and send them to us it would be great because we can just get those kind of linked up with your examples and your story This is incredibly helpful because we have  weve heard from people who sheltered civilians Weve heard from people who rescued people in other capacities But havent had anybody  and it didnt even dawn on me  how did people take care of the militaryA:Well you wouldnt  you know we dont think of the military  and they dont need taken care of But when they were trying  as people were coming in the National Guard  because they didnt know  I think at one time our most that we had there was 3000 at one time As they were coming in these guys were coming in and just  they were going out The guy that was sitting there  they had a guy and a girl sitting there Their jobs were to check everybody in They didnt have time to call restaurants They didnt have time to do that So when they said Who can do this and they said Carrie Get her in here Shell do it Im like  okay were talking about a couple hundred people Sure I can do that So it just kind of became  it kind of became just for seven days it was like  Okay get up Get up there Lets see who we can call Lets see And every day it wasnt  I never had the thought that  Okay somebodys going to come through Because some of them I had to call repeatedly But they were so willing Because they couldnt open anyways Their food was going to rot What can we do to help them You tell me what you need and well do it It just  and [ 37:57] at Academy with first responders Pastor Kyle Nix Lets see-Q:All of that would be incredibly helpful because it really helps us understand the big picture of how did this work how did it really come togetherA:It was really strange how it really came togetherQ:It sounds like it was meant to beA:If you  I think if I saw this somewhere I would think this is really fictional Because you just dont think of them calling a civilian in to help the National  you just dont think about thatQ:But you know its interesting We interviewed another woman who  the National Guard was in one of the Katy communities And they said Where are these streets How do we get there Weve never been in this neighborhood before And she literally said Ill hop on with you if you want me to and rode with them It was very much a similar situation in a very different contextA:Its very surreal to see people  we were told many times The National Guard weve never been accepted this way  treated this way because mostly people are like help us Do this do this Its not what can we do for you Its always Youre the National Guard You take care of us We were completely opposite in saying Were here to serve you What can we do It just kind of snow-balled because people wanted to do it and they were just  theyd come by every day and say We dont know what to say I think it was good for their morale It was good for our morale When they left it is almost like we all had a death in the family It was very  we went through a mourning process because we all had become so close with them with us working together 8 hours a day 7 days You become close We got to know people We got email addresses They wanted to come to our first football game come back And so when they left it was very much a  you have this moment of letdown Its like  What am I going to do tomorrow So it was kind of a  for several of us  we kind of went through a mourning processQ:How did you get the rest of your team You said that you were picky about who you let inA:We were picky My job was to sit at a desk like this and when people came in as civilians  Who are you What are you doing here You need to leave Right outside was a foyer And those were the volunteers Dr Hall  who is the principal of Katy High School  his wife his two children his teachers the president of KABC myself It was a very closed group of  most of them were employees of Katy High School But it was a very closed group of who Now people showed up to help We had one gentleman show up and he said  he was talking to me and he is in public service LaMonica came up and said I need to speak to you in private Carrie And we went inside and he said Why Why did he not let me in I said Well because this is a military base He said If I had shown him my credentials I said If you had shown him your credentials he would have said the same thing There are only certain people who are allowed in here Because it was a secure military base We had people come in and try to take pictures I had to tell one of them to leave one time She said Well I work at the administration building I said Thats great But you need to leave and dont you dare post those on Facebook And then I went to Dr Hall and I said Dr Hall I think I may have stuck my foot in my mouth because I told this woman who works at administration… He said Dont worry about it You were told by the military do not let them take pictures You did your job I said Okay I just  I just didnt want… I dont think people understood that our school became a secure military base and they did not want people taking pictures in there Anyways  oh heres Carlos from BBs He goes Theyre on the way with the delivery I said Thank you He goes You are so very welcome I said They are loving the Gumbo and he put a heart So you know Carrabas just a lot of people in the educate  Partners in Education  had a few restaurants lined up So anyway it was a group effort It wasnt just me It was a group effort And it was a really cool thingQ:Yeah really cool thing Well thank you so much for sharing Let me see if there are  just kind of look through and see if I missed anythingA:Im sorry  I just talkedQ:No this is perfect I guess the one thing that Im kind of curious about  were there things that you tried that didnt workA:No not really When we were told by a military person Can you get this for us and they would say dont worry about it  if you cant its okay And I would put out a Facebook thing and I would say  This is what we need And whoom it was like 50 people would show upQ:Was it only Facebook Did you use any other social mediaA:I only used FacebookQ:And you used your personal accountA:I would either use my personal account or  I am on a private account thats called K-Train and it stands for Katy Train It is a group that has been around forever and it is all things Katy football Katy sports And we  its a closed group I would put the word out to them And they in turn  its a close-knit group that when any of us needs anything if we put it on there we come to help each other So when I put this particular thing out on public and said we need some lotion and people started asking  that was on my public  my private account that I made public Because people would then share it They would share and share and share People in Cinco Ranch who get out who felt that they could do nothing would come over there I had one lady chew me out on social media and said  Ill have you know its not just Katy thats helping you Because I kept saying  Thank you Katy people And she said  Ill have you know  and I said  You know what Youre right I am so sorry Thank you I appreciate you And thats all she wanted was for someone to recognize her And I can do thatQ:Thats an easy thing to do I tell you Its pretty amazing So I really feel like  shes kind of told us about _[45:23]  I dont know that theres any reason to specifically ask So I guess the last thing if you dont mind would you give us  all we need are just some demographics right down here And wow What an incredible experienceA:When Nora put this out I said Nora Im not… She said Carrie you are such a big part of this I said It wasnt me that was a big part It was a whole group of us She goes But you need to goQ:Thank you We really appreciate this This is incredibly helpful Incredibly helpful Alright so weve had a Hank before so were going to have to come up with a little bit extra I think we have somebody who was

RECORDINGOR_NickyQ:First off just tell me a little bit about your job job title description what you do how you got here  that sort of thingA:Im a volunteer with Harris County ES-48 non-suppression Im on a community team I help with things like the smoke alarm blitzes  anything having to do with community outreach fire prevention And even after a fire care Making sure victims of residential fires get resources they need and help they need So Ive been with the department a little over a year and a halfQ:And youre strictly volunteerA:YesQ:So no income at allA:I get a fixed stipend because I just recently got on as an admin assistant So I am on a fixed stipend there But I did  I started out strictly volunteer Im also on the rehab unit which I dont know if yall have heard about what that is yetQ:NoA:They were instrumental in rescues also during Harvey ESU48 has a rehab group and we have  its like a big ambulance And we go on-scene and we rehabilitate firefighters on-scene We make sure theyre hydrated Make sure theyre getting snacks water Gatorade Watching for signs of heat stroke dehydration that sort of thing And they were actually off helping people during HarveyQ:So during Harvey what were you doing What was your roleA:I was at home I was in Lamishberg (SP) Parish watching the water rise up to all my neighbors houses and watching it stop at my house It got to the point where I hemmed and hawed Should I go Yeah I should go No I dont want to get out there and have my guys put into danger because they have to come rescue me And then before I knew it it was all over But I was watching the media watching my neighbors seeing who needed help and stuff Felt kind of helpless actuallyQ:You were doing this from homeA:YesQ:What were you using to  so were you still coordinating with the fire agencyA:I was watching through our apps Let me see if I can pull them up We have this one called Responder 360 and it will show  it shows all the incidents in our area Like theres a  thats an event right thereQ:So thats linked in to the dispatch hereA:Yes If you were here yesterday you heard the tone go off and then the talking They  what they say is what we see on here also And its just another way of seeing whats going on So I would watch that Of course the news was on This app is kind of like a pager and it pages out When theres something going on  like this one went off this morning and its for Tower 4 and Ladder 3 So for rehab it was going off and off It was going off a lot So I was just watching and trying to figure out how I could coordinate people and move people around if I knew them  that kind of thingQ:So what did it end up  like actually becoming  like what did you do with the information you saw thereA:There were a couple of times where  well it was difficult because we dont see whats going on in Katy And thats where a lot of I guess the hard-hitting stuff was happening the evacuations and stuff But like Id see somebody post on Facebook Oh I want to go to Starbucks I think I told a couple of friends No dont because theres water at such and such Its a bad idea to get out People would ask I need to get to my moms house Can I go Does anybody know if this way was open And I couldnt respond as an official department member but as myself I would say Dont go that way no And just that kind of thingQ:But you based that decision like on official info from SimonA:Yes from what I sawQ:What you saw on the appA:On this On those appsQ:Did people believe Did they know you were a volunteerA:Yes especially with some of the groups and some of my friends they did And if they didnt then they can just look at my page and see that I am with  and then its up to them to decide ultimatelyQ:So it sounds like it was mostly about telling people about flooded areas Or did you do coordinating in terms of sending people outA:No I didnt do any of that I was just watching and trying to put my two cents out and my opinions of what I felt was safe and wasnt safe and where I knew my guys were having issues  my guys and gals I should sayQ:What kind of issues were they encounteringA:Power lines down People trying to go out and go places  trying to go to Starbucks and getting caught in floodsQ:So would you input that into the appA:No I dont have that capability because Im just a lowly  but if I saw something then I knew I could message Simon or message one of the chiefs who were very very very busy I tried to  the plan was if there was something going on I would message one of the officers to let the chiefs knowQ:But it was just too dangerous to try to come hereA:I felt it was Thats something thats kind of stuck with me because I wonder if I could have gotten here But then I wonder how much help I really would have been That kind of thing Because when I walked in and I saw the bedding in their offices where theyd been sleeping That still sticks with me That was huge I was home with my family I knew my son was safe At one point my house did start taking on water It wasnt much but its  it all-Q:So those interactions where you would say Dont go to Starbucks was that on Facebook or InstagramA:Facebook Im mainly FacebookQ:Yeah wed love to see some of those Part of what were doing is getting those screenshots and seeing kind of how conversations unfolded as well If you dont mind sharing it Its all going to be anonymous Its never going to be put anywhere So anyones name we will definitely blur out You said it was kind of emotional to see the bedding And they were here Was it otherwise an emotional experienceA:Yes because not knowing how bad it was going to get Like I said all the neighbors across the street of me and to the left of me their homes flooded and they were I think  well they all had to be rescued But one we heard the loud engines at one point and we walked outside and theres a National Guard truck next door rescuing people next door Because they had infants and puppies and stuff like that That was hard And then my neighbor across the street watching her  shes a veteran Shes military And watching her break down and watching it happen literally across the street Okay its getting closer Its in the kitchen Okay thats it Im calling Were leaving She put down the time she called  I think there was one main number that you had to call to be put on the list and they would come out and get youQ:Was that a number for here or National GuardA:I dont know It was just a main  I dont remember who sourced it but it was  I think it was started just for that purpose to call and you would be put on the list You would tell them where you are and you would be put on a list and the next available rescuers would be out to get you  whether it be National Guard ESD whoeverQ:Gotcha So was your house spared just based on elevation you thinkA:I think so I think so The ones that were the worst  my neighborhood backs up to the Morton Ranch  or Morton Creek Retention Pond And so that of course came over the banks I think thats why the houses across the street were so bad because they back up to it And then I live on the center of the street where the neighbors farther down theres a curve at a corner I think thats lower elevation and I think thats why they went down It was scary very scaryQ:So what was going through your mind when you were seeing every other house but yours is basically getting A:It was hard It was  I was  I was trying to think of Okay Im going to get rid of all the clothes I dont wear Get rid of everything I dont need because these people just lost everything And we did I packed up stuff and took it to shelters and whatever just trying to give backQ:Did you take any photos or anything during the event Like flood waters or whatA:Yes I have picturesQ:Thatd be stuff wed also want to grab as wellA:DefinitelyQ:So what was different about this emergency compared to other things youve been involved withA:The scale of it Just purely the scale of it and knowing that first responders were being affected also I dont consider myself a first responder because Im not But I work with them And knowing that theyre out there saving lives they were a lot of them  knowing that they were out there saving lives when their own houses and families were being rescued That was hard That was different Because its normally the first responders are heroes and theyre untouchable Superman That wasnt the case this timeQ:So what was most helpful for you to make an impact during this emergencyA:I dont know that I made an impact I utilized what I knew of the Katy area and the friendships that Ive made in the past 20 years Ive been here And just that kind of thingQ:So you say you utilized those  how Just knowingA:The Katy train I dont know if you know about thatQ:Someone mentioned it yesterday Its a big groupA:Yes a group Katy High School fans  parents former parents alumni  anybody who likes Katy High School for any reason Were all in this group called the Katy Train And a lot of them are officials within the City of Katy higher ups Just people that  its the old man when you drive by the Barber Shop and hes sitting there and he knows just anybody and everything Just those kind of people And they started putting people out  Hey we need people to pull drywall Can a group of kids go here And it just  it gelled into this amazing  I dont even know what to call it It was just  it was amazing They were getting people help that needed it like thatQ:So is it fair to say that most of your efforts were post-emergency with like donation and giving things Or do you think during you were able to help as wellA:I tried to help as much as I could but without the resources I just mainly tried to direct people to other people that I knew had the resources And then after there was another group out of Kingsland Baptist Church and I think the pastors name was Omar and he started a website for kind of like the Katy Train group but it was an actual website about Katy-area disaster response Something like that It was a place of resources where if you needed baby formula you could go to this site and say Okay this fire department has baby formula This such and such this grocery store is still open this Target still has bread  that kind of thing I just tried to direct people to thoseQ:What does the Katy Train normally do Whats a normalA:Brag about football  Katy footballQ:So theres no real like park clean-up days or anything through thereA:No I mean they put that kind of thing out there Hey this group is doing  but it is normally strictly Katy Katy sports And of course the big thing here is Katy football And that was one of things with school being out and some of these kids  the football players especially  were not sitting idle but needed something to do Lets put them to work So they did And the soccer teams and the softball teams They were going out and cleaning and helping peopleQ:Do you think it was important that they already kind of had that team  like the football team the soccer teamA:Yes yesQ:How soA:Because they knew they could be trusted They knew  okay Robert Willoughby is sending this group of people over Hes a good guy I know these kids will be  instead of just a group of kids from so and so You dont know if theyre going to end up looting your house That was huge because people were worried about it My husband at one point was walking up and down the street with his gun looking for lootersQ:Was that actually happening Were people being looted that you sawA:Yes Not that I saw personally but Id heard of it and we know its a thing So we were very cautious of itQ:So what did you try to communicate that maybe didnt work out so wellA:Nothing that I can think of Just initially in the beginning just to stay home I dont think people were taking the threats as seriously Which I dont blame them because it was Oh Harveys going to be this No its going to be but then as the calls started coming and I was seeing more and more Yeah no dont get out because even if you can get to where youre going safely if something  thats more traffic on the roads that the fire trucks have to wait for you to go through the lights That kind of mentality People werent getting that But it is what it isQ:Were people taking it as seriously as you think they should have leading up to it Or was it kind of not  its just a bunch of rain attitudeA:I think initially it was that UnfortunatelyQ:So at what point did it become  this is serious Or did it vary person to personA:It varied but I think after the third day of nothing but rain and nothing but tornado alerts I think it started sinking inQ:So Simons out of sight too and we keep everything anonymous What could they do for volunteers to make you more effective Like what would you like to see happen in an ideal worldA:Maybe a little bit more communication And just knowing  hey were good We dont need anything That kind of thingQ:Of the fire agency or EMS saying that were goodA:Or we dont need anything Just communication Hey do not try to get here if you feel its dangerous but if you can get here we could use volunteers doing this Even admin people were here helping I would have come up here and been laundering made coffee or whatever for them just so that they could concentrate on  but I didnt know if I should  (1) should could  that kind of thingQ:Alright anything else that were not asking that we should that would help us understand this betterA:Not that I can think of I think it would be a huge help if there were some sort of county-wide state-wide more centralized kind of thing going on Something like that  that would have  because we had the Katy Train but weve been there foreverQ:So are you referring to like social mediaA:Just where to go for that information but have it be  because I would look at something and it would say This is coming from El Paso or Amarillo It like youve neve been to Katy you dont know what its like here But a place to input data like that but that can be accessed by anyone and everything Just a thoughtQ:Okay One thing that I want to jump back to  do you have another job or is this your full-timeA:I did work for Hallmark  I was a retail merchandiser And I left there in January to do this Im an admin assistant part-time but I do do other things I want to be a CPR instructor rehab group Im working on an after-fire assistance program that kind of thingQ:Okay cool So the last thing well get is…END OF RECORDINGR  John SnowAUDIO 1Q:Alright so yeah go ahead and start sharing with me some of what happened You were telling me that you were in your apartment  you were in the second floorA:Yeah I was on the second floor So the water got high enough to where it caused water damage because it pretty much seeped through the drywall and everything from the first floor So a lot of my stuff has water damage in it So Ive pretty much just thrown everything away Theyre finally refinishing my apartment now And so but the thing is half my stuff is already gone So its just like  what the heck I ended up going to stay with my mom for a couple of weeks  Ive been with her for the last  what  three months now Its just been crazy hectic because  its just something that you dont ever expect to happen Like I knew my apartment was slightly in an area that didnt  I guess didnt drain as well as it should But you know its not like when you sign the lease agreement theyre like Oh this is a flood zone And so  we have all new apartments along that entire street Its like  Okay I didnt realize that were part of the Addicks  I think its Addicks Reservoir And so we have retention ponds out there Im not originally from Texas so I didnt even know what a retention pond wasQ:You know what Im from Texas and I didnt necessarily know what they wereA:I always thought they were just big giant things back there Theres one right behind my apartment And so that thing looked like a lake the first day And then the second day was when it just all  hell just hit the fan It was just  it was just the water just never stopped I was constantly on the phone with one of my coworkers because she lives  she lived off of Highway 6 and Clay Road The thing is the week before we had heavy rain so her house had actually got slight water damage in the carpets the first week And so they were closing on their new house which is in a completely different area that week So everything was packed She was ready to go She was like Im just so excited to get out of this place And the weekend  the week that they were supposed to close which was like that Thursday before it happened something happened with the sellers where they didnt do what they were supposed to do so they had to stay in the house another week And then that weekend Harvey hit It hit her even worse It completely like submerged almost the house So all her stuff in boxes and they were completed ruined It was  I was on the phone with her the whole time because the first day just like me she was like Oh yeah I think were going to be fine Everythings in boxes We put everything on the counters because we learned from last week And the whole process she was Chris the water it just keeps getting higher Were going to have to get out of here We slept with water under our bed And so luckily the next day the water had went down a little bit so they were able to get out of the house But then that night everything just went  and so me and her have just been trying to figure things out Were just  its so hectic losing every  luckily she didnt lose her car She was able to get her cars of there the day that it wasnt raining I didnt think we were going to flood I was thinking everything is perfectly fine My mom was like Hey you sure you dont want to come over here I was like No Id rather just stay at my house I just bought all this water and food Im going to eat this stuff Then we lost power and then it was just hectic Me and my sister live in the same apartments so the exact same situation happened to her We ended up just hanging out the whole couple of days that we were there And then they started doing the evacuations When they came in the  first they came in on the big Army vehicles When they came in the Army vehicles they were like You guys need to get out of here Were like No I think were fine because it was still kind of raising up And then that next day is when it really hit They were debating on releasing the reservoirs And the water just kept backing up backing up backing up The first thing we went out  we went out when it was still just a little bit of water on the streets And the water was flowing like a river on the streetQ:Did you  were you taking pictures of all of thisA:I have a couple Let me see I have a couple of them Because I had one the first day we went outside We thought  it just seemed  it was just like an unreal situation because you just  you dont expect water to damage to this extentQ:And to be flowing down the streetA:No Not at all It was literally a river This was like the first day  hold on So this was like the first day when we were just sitting inside Hopefully my phone loads But this was just like the first day There was just a little bit of water out there  enough to where I couldnt drive our cars in the streetQ:Oh yes I see thatA:So were just sitting in there you know And then theyre coming back up and it just started getting higher And then literally that night like three cars got stuck on our street The cars were literally stuck on the street like done And there was people walking up and down the street Wheres the part where were like walking through the water and the waters flowing at one pointQ2:These look like SnapChats rightA:Yeah Because the thing is we thought it was a joke the first day And so were like walking through this waterQ:Oh my gosh That is amazing that pictureA:That water was literally flowing down the streetQ:How do we  that would be super helpful I dont have anything like that Thats the Army vehicle rightA:YeahQ:And thats yall walking down the street What are your thoughts in terms of -Q2:Do you have these SnapChat videos saved on your phoneA:I can save them yeahQ2:If you could would you be willing to save the videos and then text them to our project phoneA:Thats no problemQ2:Thatd be awesome Otherwise we could take a video  I could take a video of the SnapChat videoQ:That would probably be the easiest  if he could send them to youA:Yeah I can definitely send them Thats no problemQ2:Thats great We can coordinate that after the interviewQ:I dont have my-Q2:I have the numberQ:You have the phone number handy  good  for the project phone Its so funny I know my phone number Dont know my project numberA:But the water was just like  it was just so high in different areas And it was the fact that it was just flowing down the river It was like  this is an area that I drive up and down the street every day I even drove this way coming today And to see that it was just flowing over the entire byway was just like intense And sadly I dont have the ones of my actual  I think theyre on my computer but I dont knowQ:One thing that we actually just had a gentleman send me this morning  because we have a dedicated email address and a phone number for the project its the kind of thing that if you happen to have a few minutes and could send them to us when you got home that would be absolutely fine They can come to us anytimeA:This is us walking through the streets[VIDEO PLAYING]Q:This was at night tooA:Yeah I had a couple of them during the day This was the second day  we were walking around all of Memorial Park downtown was completed flooded I dont even know To try to relive that situation again I would never  and even at the end of this lease  my lease renewal is at the end of this week Theyre like Are you going to renew I was like Im fine I think Im okay Im going to do a little more research this time into where I wanted to Luckily I was actually  last year I was going to move to a different set of apartments that completely got flooded up to the third floor So luckily I didnt do that one because then that would have been me completely Its just to know that there were so many people that have gone through this situation Its like  its nice to know that youre not the only one because theres other people that have been understanding of the situation My boss was very understanding of knowing that I wasnt even going to come to work But the thing is I work off commission So not being able to go to work losing my car  and then FEMA didnt  they didnt assist at all So its like  I have a $500 deductible that I had to pay on top of still having to pay rent on a flooded apartment Its just so much different scenarios that came into it Having to buy a whole nother car Its like this and that My insurance is going up because of a flood vehicle Its just like all these different unseen factors And then its just  its very crippling as well because knowing that youre being-[INTERRUPTION]Q:Could you do me one favor Do you mind when youre finished could you come back and finish-A:Yes I can definitely come back in here with you guysQ:Thank you we so appreciate it Your information is so incredibly valuable I would love to capture it I definitely dont want you to lose your spot in line Thank you so very muchAUDIO 2Q:So we are back with John Snow And we had already talked about kind of this story and how you got evacuated You shared with us some of your images We were going to see if you could forward the videos you saved  let us give you our project email Do we have that handyQ2:Yeah I can give you the phone number too Or if its faster for me to just film video of a videoA:Either one is fine I dont know if you guys cared for the qualityQ:Yeah we can probably forward itQ2:Yeah I can get the project phone numberQ:If youll grab that number that would be great And then let me just kind of continue down here So Im curious And then once we talk social media well talk that But what did you find most helpful during your rescueA:Just the fact that everybody was just really working together truly and honestly Its crazy to see how a lot of times you-[INTERRUPTION]Q:Glad they could help you with that So the fact that everybody was working together really made a big differenceA:Yeah it did just because there were so many people that were affected And to know that there were people coming from Dallas from San Antonio from Austin from different states just to be able to help this one cause It was just kind of  it kind of just warmed you up a little bit just in this like crazy disastrous time It was just  everybody was just so opening I had family members I rarely even talked to that were calling and saying Hey are you okay Do you need to come over here We know what just happened It was just  it was truly the people because truly and honestly theres nothing good about anything that happened other than just people coming together and being able to helpQ:Thats wonderful So you mentioned you have some SnapChats that you did What other types of social media or apps did you use during this timeA:There was one on Facebook where Facebook notices theres an extreme event where you can mark yourself safe That was very helpful because I did have a lot of family that were constantly trying to figure out what was going on At one point we did lose power and I didnt have my cell phone anymore So once I was able to get back to electricity and charge my phone and actually go on Facebook I was actually able to mark myself safe so a lot of my family members were able to kind of like be at peace Like I said Im not originally from Texas Im from California and I have family in California and Illinois and everywhere So theyre so far away that they have no idea whats going on All my best friends in California  when I did turn my phone one I think I had 45 missed calls from everyone trying to get in contact with me It was just surreal to know that so many people know It was really sweet to know that all my friends and family in different areas were still trying to find out  people I dont even talk to anymore  people from like Junior High Chris are you okay Whats going on We know you moved to Houston but what happened So Facebook was definitely one of them SnapChat was pretty much the easiest quick one to do and then as well just saving my videos on my phone pretty much were it Those were pretty much the major ones that are able to  probably the biggest outreach Its like an instantaneous thing to where people know whats going on step by step process It was a pretty powerful thing And to see other peoples stories as well because as I was posting some I could see that other people were going through other things Thats the only way I knew my step-sister  shes actually shes from Illinois and she moved here to be closer to me and my sister  she lived a street down and the same situation was happening with her It was surreal because its like Oh god were all going through it So my dad is calling all of us Hes like Whats going on All my kids are going  whats going on with you guys It was just to see everyones stories Some people were fine and some people were having more like scares Just to see that everybody across Houston was affected in the city somewhere or another The gravity of the situation is immense just to know that in an entire city one of the largest cities in the United States was just punched in the gut all by some water by some rain To think that Harvey was not really a storm it was just a lot of rain  a lot of rain It starts to make you question just like the infrastructure of how things are made how theyre designed What are we doing from here forward to fix this Because its not Houston is used to not having rain Its not like its not going to happen again What are you guys going to do now to alleviate this issue later on down the road So its pretty  it made me a lot more aware of just about everything that goes to  just  its just been  yeah its been definitely a journey these last couple of months And even three or four months down the road Im still having to like deal with the situations that were back in August Its like my birthday was like last week and I was like I have to just get away from this whole area So my friends from California we all pitched in and we all made a trip to New York It was just a nice trip to be able to get away from everything going on here in Houston Now Im like I want to move to New York At least I dont have to worry about the floods But they had Sandy so maybe I shouldnt jump too soonQ:Did you ever call 911 in this processA:No  well yes and no I did once and it was not going through It was such a huge thing and even my sister when she was telling me shes like Theres no way to even call them because theres so many people calling in at this point Youre literally pointless wasting the power on the phone And that was the one time I was so conscious about how much power I had on my phone Ive never  my phones never three days on not a charge So I put it on battery save mode I even like deleted apps off my phone just so they werent even working because I was like I dont when Im going to be able to have electricity again and I wasnt sure when we were going to be able to get rescued Ive never been so conscious of having a phone charger at all times Luckily during the times of the rain I was constantly keeping it plugged in because I didnt know if the power was going to go out And we did keep having power outages constantly And so Id be on the phone with my friend because he lives down the street  he got flooded as well We all live pretty much in this one little vicinity And all of our apartments were  he lost his car as well It was just like  the whole time Im talking to him hes like Dude  because hes right by the power lines and hes like the power lines are really shaking like bad I can see little sparks coming out of the thing Im like Dude Im pretty sure were powered by the same power lines So if yours goes out mines going out Wed literally be on the phone and be like Powers out And a second later mine was out too I was like Hopefully its not out too long I was like I have all this food in the fridge Luckily my phone is still at 100  I just kept it plugged in the whole time because it was the only way for my mom to even keep in contact with me because she was just having a mental breakdown because her two kids were at the exact same place and theres no way for her to get to us I felt so helpless because I wasnt able to help my mom Even though it was her trying to figure out whats going on with usQ:Thats good That is probably such a real emotion there So what Id like to do is lets go ahead and lets get the phone out and lets talk phone for a minute Here is the phone number  probably its easier for you to text them to us rightA:Yeah yeahQ:So thats the phone number that you can text those to And then when you have them open we might kind of  so the ones that you showed us would be really helpful And then if you have any other images of either people being rescued you being rescued your apartment-A:____[8:59] this one in my-Q:Yes oh thats so realA:These are on SnapChat as wellQ:So what you can do on that phone  cant he hold the power button down and do a screen shotQ2:Or if theyre actual images you can just send themA:Yeah I saved these ones so I can actually send these ones as wellQ:Wonderful Thats greatA:It was just so many people so many people And you dont  you dont really see  you dont know who your neighbors are until this is happening because everyones outside And to see all your neighbors going through the exact same thing it was just  its like I dont even have words At some point I have friends who ask How was it One of my friends who lived here in Houston his entire life had just moved to Dallas like the week before Harvey hit He was like Dude I got out in perfect time I was like Yeah you didQ:It does sound that wayA:And just to know that so much stuff has happened in this whole month and to know that everybody in Houston was really able to come together really  and even agencies like this that have been able to assist in situations like this  because I was just flipping out I work off commission like I said and to know  I pretty much went three weeks without any type of pay And also having to pay a car deductible and pretty much depleting my savings just to hold myself over And then having to now play catch-up And even hearing about  like some of these apartments out there are charging more for rent because they know that the influx of people that need places to stay How are you going to try to capitalize on a disaster  on a disaster Its just  its insane You would think that you would have some type of compassion and sympathy towards the situation and yet you guys are once again capitalizing on the whole situation Its just  its really disgusting I dont even know how to  And like now we were just talking to the  we called my apartment complex We were like Hey  an agency thats willing to help out with the past due from August And they wont accept their form of payment Im like  theyre literally willing to write a check for the amount and my apartments like No we just cant accept that way so sorry Im like so right now Im going to have to go there and plead with them because Im like  at this point its going to complete get put an eviction on my credit which is going to cripple me towards finding anything else My lease is up in January You guys are going to evict me now So what am I going to do for my next apartment because you guys wont accept a payment that is completely valid Its just  I dont even understand why people  I dont understand But fingers crossed that they find it in their hearts to allow me to be able to give this form of payment just so I can at least just finish out my lease and then move on from there I would never live there again but its just  let me just finish it out Dont screw me over in this situation Ive been still steadily paying rent on an apartment that I havent even been living in because theyve been still fixing it I still have to pay rent on an apartment that I havent even lived in in the last two monthsQ:ReallyA:Yeah So I just got a paper in the mail saying that theres an evictionEND OF RECORDINGR_GeriQ:I have a good friend growing up whose name was Geri and she spelled it just like mine except with a G So essentially what were really trying to do here is were trying to figure out what real calls for help and rescue efforts look like especially in social media Our hope is that we can create a database that identifies what these real calls look like so in the future emergency responders will be able to go in to tell real versus fake calls for help So thats kind of our long-term dream So far by really getting people to share with us what was real its given us a lot of insight into how people are asking for help and how theyre sharing those calls for help with othersA:I can give what information I can I _[1:02] all of it but as far as I know an Instagram of - [1:10] of how _Q:So it was an Instagram post that helped you get picked up from the shelter did you say Or taken to the shelterA:We evacuated from our home [1:30] house did not flood But I dont know if you saw the length of my husbands article but the [1:35] encounter evacuation experience We have a one-story We could have been safe if we stayed here but just the uncertainty was difficult to manage especially with a one-year old  February We decided with the one-story with no idea of how long the rain is going to stop it looks like the weather - ____ was saying that we have two or three more days of constant rain We decided to make the move to our neighbors two-story and then from there other neighbors gave us an opportunity to evacuate by boat We ended up being picked up by a Texas Game Warden and a Ft Ben County Sheriff So from there they dropped us off at a  at the end of the flooded zone onto a highway And a stranger picked us up He was trying to get his sister and his sister was  I think she was flooded in her own house She had told her brother Dont come after me Theres no way you can get in here without a boat Ill be fine And he decided he didnt want to leave the area without helping someone else out So he picked us up and drove us quite a while to a available shelter From that I just snapped an Instagram photo of my baby sleeping in the shelter And we had some really great experiences with the people working at the shelter as well And then that went to my Facebook account I dont constantly check my phone and the Wi-Fi was rather bad in the shelter area depending on where you were But I had friends from Facebook contacting their friends who were living in the area in Rosenberg close to the shelter where we had been evacuated who were able to pick us about around  I think it must have been something like 8:00 pm that night  I was asked to text the stranger friend of a friend That friend responded immediately and took us to her parents house She sheltered us for two days which was greatQ:It is amazing I agree with you Youd written that email  its just amazing how people from all backgrounds all attitudes came together and pulled together to help each other out It sounds like strangers as wellA:Yes Im very proud of Houston I love my neighbors The people that I didnt know came out and were helping each other Strangers from all different cultures and backgrounds Houston is so diverse I teach at one of the six most diverse universities in the US right nowQ:ReallyA:Yeah Houston is so diverse Houston Baptist University where I work is extraordinarily diverse And I think that is one of the reasons why Houston did so well helping each other with the floods because we were just very easily able to cross boundaries and trust others and reach out and lend a helping handQ:Wow thats a very interesting perspective You know you could be right It is such a diverse community I had no idea Houston Baptist was the sixth most diverse Thats pretty amazingA:Its [5:22] you heard a few years ago Recently I think recently its because theyre tied for 4th in the region for the United States I dont know exactly where it stands currently but yes its a diverse universityQ:So do you still have that picture that you snapped of our baby and the things that you postedA:I think I do For the sake of anonymity would we be able to block out the face or confidentialityQ:You know okay So let me tell you what we have We have a dedicated phone that goes straight to our Box site which is high security protected So no one will see it but people from our study that are all IRB cleared If youre comfortable with that it would never ever leave our research team But if you would like his face blocked out I am fairly certain that I have a colleague whos very sophisticated and that would not be a problem We could take care of that for you as well We dont care whos in the pictures Were really looking to characterize whats physically in the pictures and what the pictures representA:Okay That sounds good to me If you want me to I can also find the post  what I wrote and give you the caption too Thats fine with me I just would prefer if youd block out his faceQ:I can do that Thats not a problem I will make a note My graduate students are sitting right here with me so we will put that in the file and make sure that happens Why dont I give you that phone number that you could  would it be best to text it to us do you think You could do like screen shots if you know how to do that on your phoneA:Yeah thats good I can do that Im just trying to scroll back and see if I can find [7:30] Ill do my best to answer your questionsQ:That would be wonderful Let me give you that phone number that goes straight to our research site Its 512-A:Im sorry hold on one second Okay 512-Q:460-A:460-Q:0818A:Okay 512-460-0818Q:Thats correct Thats correctA:Great Okay Sounds good Just text it you saidQ:Uh-huh You can text it and well let you know  it should come in on a different phone in a minute When it gets there I can be sure that weve gotten it If you have any other pictures that either show things that were happening that led you to realize that you needed to be rescued were also looking for things that kind of depict what a rescue looks likeA:Well for us it looks like a really weird space because it just  for me it felt awkward to do one when other people in my neighborhood were riding it out I also  there was also the question of whether or not we needed to be rescued in the first place I can send you a copy of our neighborhood flooded and me and my child in the Texas Game Wardens boat but thats the same picture thats on my husbands article because he snapped themQ:Yeah that would be greatA:And Im wearing an Orioles hat only because its my husbands hat and I was protecting my childQ:I understand I get thatA:JokingQ:You know but you raise something really interesting Were hearing a lot from people what you just expressed which is this feeling of  I wasnt sure that it made sense to be rescued I might feel guilty I might feel odd I think that that was a fairly common reaction that people had And so how would you characterize that emotionA:Just not wanting special treatment and  I think it was most difficult for us as we were leaving the sand boat My husband talked a little bit about this experience in his article but leaving the sand boat and seeing people yelling and asking to be in a boat or angry that the sheriff would not stop in their place as theyre watching the water lap into their porch or into the threshold of their house And just wondering  Im strong and able-bodied its not fair that these people are not being helped right nowQ:Yeah that makes sense But you had a one-year old with you right And then you were pretty pregnantA:Well not pretty pregnant Im due in February And also the nervousness  the fact that I wasnt eating for a while either so I didnt look pregnant at all at the time My husband also talked about his little memory of the Texas Game Warden where  I forget who it was  it might have been the Ft Ben County Sheriff or deputies saying Are you sure youre pregnant Ive heard a lot about pregnant people at this timeQ:No reallyA:Yeah so  I mean well because there were all these  and when you dont look like you have special needs and youre given some special treatment it can be socially embarrassing I thinkQ:Absolutely Thats really helpful information I completely understand what youre saying with that Im also kind of curious  other than Face  you mentioned Facebook Youve mentioned Instagram Where there other apps or other pieces of social media that you might have usedA:Yes we were monitoring NextDoor which is a neighborhood app Youre probably familiar with that And mostly just because we were wondering what other people were experiencing as our neighbors were being flooded and if we could anticipate that happening NextDoor was useful There was also  my husband actually dropped the NextDoor app because of this experience because there was a lot of false information on there as well There was a point where the crisis was over and people started looking for people to blame It was more about who we should sue than how to help each other NextDoor app was also very helpful for the recovery effort for people saying  Hey I have all this extra  extra cleaning supplies Or  this is where you go if you need this Or  go to the library Go to our __[12:49] And  if you want to help out or if you need something  So that was very useful for the recovery efforts as wellQ:That makes sense Did yall ever call 9-1-1A:No I didnt consider our situation more of an emergency than what other people were going through And I just suspected that the lines were flooded by terrible Q:Oh yeah absolutely That makes senseA:I think that we did hear that people who had called numbers that were posted on the NextDoor app for evacuation were receiving 48-hour rescue time So it just didnt seem like  that was one of the reasons that we decided to take the opportunity when we had it too because we didnt know how long the rains were going to continue and when our next opportunity to evacuate would appear if there were to be anyQ:That makes complete senseA:9-1-1 I just thought  9-1-1 is a great idea for emergencies And when you have an emergency stage where everybody is in emergency maybe the people with the most  the direst situation should have those lines open for themQ:Yeah that makes sense So one of the other things were interested in is  we know a fair bit about mobile devices and social media And theres this concept that are these various features of social media And Id love to kind of list some of them out and you tell me what you think in terms of  Was this something that you thought was important for your rescue And then  What do you think about whether it was important for the people who rescued you Okay So the first one is locatability Was that something important that mobile devices played a role in to help them locate your or notA:No not as far as I know Although I would assume that the answer should be yes But for us we had the neighbor just give a home addressQ:Thats helpful then What about being reached Reachability Was that important for you during the rescue with mobile devicesA:To have someone be able to call usQ:YeahA:Yes Yeah And we  we didnt really take that for granted but we were relieved that we never lost cell phone service throughout all of this So we did communicate with neighborsQ:Okay And what about portability To be able to move it with youA:AffordabilityQ:Port P-O-R-T PortabilityA:Oh portability WhatQ:Of your device Of the fact that you could keep it with you Was that importantA:Sure In this day and age everybody wants a device available to themQ:So what about persistence The fact that it would kind of keep existing after the rescue was overA:Im sorry what did you say WhatQ:Persistence The fact that it was still available after the rescue was over  the information things on Facebook Was that importantA:Are you referring to the ability to contact someone to be rescued Or are you referring to just a log of my interactions with someoneQ:Thats a great question Its more the logA:Okay That would only be important to me looking back on my experience in order to express gratitude to thank people We were glad that a neighbor snapped a photo of us so that my husband could recognize the game warden  I mean the Ft Bend officer so that when he saw him again he could physically meet him recognize his face and was able to thank him That might have been able  that might not have been something that he could do in the moment because when youre in a crisis situation or an emergency youre not really thinking  Hey let me just zero in on this persons face so that I can thank this person later That was useful to usQ:That makes good sense So the last couple of things that I wanted to ask  we are collecting just some very general 4 questions worth of demographics if youd be willing to provide thatA:Yes no problemQ:So gender Female Is that rightA:YesQ:Okay your race/ethnicityA:CaucasianQ:Your ageA:36Q:Okay And then we have several socio-economic status buckets So under $15K $15K-30K $31K-45K $46K-75K and over $75KA:Are you talking about household or personalQ:It is householdA:Okay household is about $75KQ:Okay Alright And then the last thing that I always like to ask is  is there anything we havent asked Well be able to go back through and reread  I skimmed the article that you sent me But we can go back and read that in a lot greater detail But is there anything else that I havent asked that you think might be helpful for this projectA:Im not entirely sure of how in the project this is going to be used But if you have any more information you want to share with me then maybe something will come to mind But I think youve been asking all the right questions Im very interested in the results of your project and what conclusions might arise But that now might not be the right time for you to share thatQ:Well what I can share so far is that weve interviewed about  almost 10 people people who were rescued and then a couple of people who rescued others And were certainly already seeing some trends My thought is that were probably going to have some preliminary findings in pretty decent shape by about May or June of next year You know how academia is right We actually are responsible to report back our findings to the National Science Foundation So its the type of thing that I can make a note in your file that when we get an executive summary together Ill send it to youA:Sure that would be great Im curious about these thingsQ:Youre also in academia and you understand teaching and learning Were going to link our findings very clearly to the classes that we teach as well So I will do thatA:Im sorry it is taking me so long but I did send a screen shot to that number and its not working So Im not sure why It may have just gone throughQ:Let me check right fast and well see if that works The other thing I dont know if its easier to email it but you have my email as well Did it come through Oh we did just get it So it did come through So thats great Okay And thats no problem we can definitely work on blanking out his faceA:Is that your email I know youre getting some reflection in itQ:No its clear We can definitely see that That will work great And if you happen to kind of flip through your phone and see anything else that was very kind of rescue-focused if you would just kind of text those to us Thats a dedicated phone for the project so it doesnt come in to anybodys personal phone We would sure appreciate itA:Okay I can look through text message conversations but I am interested in whether or not that would be a breach of confidentiality for the other peopleQ:Considering the fact that its not going to go anywhere and were actually going to pull  all were really interested in is content We dont care who talked to whom we only care about what was said and what the pictures illustrate Were deliberately trying to  thats why were using pseudonyms And when things come in they all stay behind our password protected  we actually have to upload them to UT servers within a certain period of time so were really careful about doing all thatA:Sounds great I trust in your resources and UTQ:Yeah So what do you teachA:I teach literature at HBUQ:Okay How wonderfulA:You contacted Abby Heller thenQ:I did YepA:Did you choose Kingswood simply because that college was devastated by flooding What brought you to AbbyQ:Yeah  so Abby was actually one of my first PhD students I was her advisor So when it happened I called her and said Abby I dont know Houston well but I was  my house was flooded when I was in the 3rd grade and there was 5 feet of water in my house for over 2 weeks And we lost everything We didnt have flood insurance And I said I just feel like I need to do this project I am being called to make sure that I give back because every piece of furniture I grew up on was donated by somebody So its really kind of affected me my whole life Its something that I believe in When I saw this call for the National Science Foundation I literally stayed up for four straight days and wrote the application Wrote the proposal And then of all the fluke-y things got it Well this was meant to be when these things happenA:Thats beautiful I hope the information you collected useful to youQ:Yes veryA:And helpful to others I appreciate just the concern and the kindness that goes behind that selection Best wishes to you during your studies If you do have for some reason a follow-up question feel free to callQ:Thank you so much I really appreciate it Thanks for your time and enjoy the rest of your short eveningA:Sure my pleasure Take careQ:Thank you Bye-byeEND OF RECORDINGR_TammyStephenQ:If yall are okay if we start recording Okay coolT:So the house I grew up in Meyerland never flooded It was built by my parents in 1961 And all those other floods never flooded But this year it did So were not in it Weve been out of it for years But its just this was one of those weird floods  weird rainsQ:It was It was And theres no way to predict whether or not were going to have another oneS:Well its interesting We could  our house is  weve been in our house for 26 years And weve had  weve gone through Alicia  all these different storms and everything and never had as much as water accumulating on the curbside We never had anything This  you say it could happen again If we get a hurricane were fine Let it come in and go Well it went up through Corpus Christi as you know Came back down made a U-turn and then just sat over Houston And somewhere between 40 and 51 inches depending on what part of the city you were in 4-51 inches in a 5-day period Cant do it Cant handle itQ:Right So yall were affected by a flood Not necessarily directly a hurricaneS:Correct We were affected by the Barker ReservoirT:Were the high point in our neighborhoodQ:You areT:Yeah Because the house across the street from us had 0 water in the houseS:The only house in the neighborhoodT:Then we had 4 inches of water Which of course you still have to do all the same stuffS:You have to tear out 4 feet of sheetrockT:It went up from there as the amount of water in peoples homes  because we are  luckily somewhat were at the highest point in the neighborhood So we would never have water in front of our house  everQ:So what was the neighborhoodS:Kellier Greens Kellier Greens Its right off of Frye Road between Westheimer Parkway and Mason Road And that entire strip right there got inundatedT:Were in section 1 which is on the north side of Frye And then section 2 is the one that actually backs up to the reservoir  part of that section does So some of those houses had 2 feet of waterQ:In your general neighborhood how much did most people have What was kind of the rangeS:Four inches up to probably a couple of feet maybeT:18  not 18 feet 18 inchesQ:To a couple of feet And if I remember right a fair number of those houses are multi-storiedS:Yeah were in a two-storyT:I think in our subdivision on our side theres only one single-storyQ:Wow So you were sharing a while ago the videoS:The video of us being rescuedQ:Of yall being rescued Walk me through what that looked like and how you made that decisionS:Ill let her walk you through itT:Well I hadnt looked at it since that weekend So I pulled up my FacebookS:Because she started communicating via Facebook that morning August 28 was my birthday And I was sitting in my recliner watching the water slowly come up our walkway We had water come in at 5 something in the morning on August 29 Thats when Terri started communicating and saying  Hey we need help We knew even though there was water just starting to come in our house there was no access We couldnt get out If we tried to go out to Frye Road theres 4-5 feet of water on Frye RoadT:I went out on Saturday So it had started raining and then it stopped for most of Saturday And thats how Sams sister-in-law was able to  she lives with  I mean his sister lives with us And she had spent the night Friday night at her daughters which lives-S:25 minutes-T:Yeah 25 minutes Right at 99 and I-10S:Beltway and I-10T:Beltway 8 and I-10 And so she was able to come home I was walking out just to see what  it had to have been Sunday morning So I was walking around to see what the water had done And it had gone down a lot in the neighborhood but Frye Road was still flooded So she-S:But then the rains came back and kept comingQ:Exactly Kept comingT:Wi-Fi is not-Q:Do you want to get the project phone Because it might actually  if its her Facebook account it might be easier to see if we can take some snapshots of what you posted Had you been monitoring various social media platforms before or not reallyT:No The only thing I ever do is Facebook So Q:Yall dont have Next DoorT:I didnt I am now But I was not before Old schoolQ:No I understand For always Ive studied this type of stuff for a while and I tell everybody-S:What month are you in right

conducting  taking  we started conducting these interviews in October The further back we get when people want to show us stuff it takes a lot longer to scroll and findS:Here it is Shes got it I see all these-T:I know Im trying to find my initial postS:Which was on August 29T:Right Okay so  no thats not my post Its somebody elses Thats not me I shared that Its coming Thats the 27th so its got to be this week I was watching Facebook Okay so this is-S:This is what she posted This is on FacebookQ:Water about to enter the house Okay Do you mind if we take  we have a dedicated project phoneQ1:Were just going to capture the-Q:And who is normally in your Facebook feed Are these friends Are they familyT:So obviously over the years Ive reconnected with a lot of peopleS:Theres tons of commentsQ1:I know I seeT:I went to University of Missouri for college and I went to overnight camp in Wisconsin And the people from there  the girls  it was an all-girls camp The girls from there were from all over the country  California a lot from Minnesota primarily Chicago There were quite a few from the Houston area And so now of course over the years people have disbursed from their hometownsS:Anything you see  okay I was going to say anything that you see outside of these things  anything you see going up that way is all probably the next 48 hours of postsT:You can go through Thats fine Im  thats fine So I have a girlfriend that I went to camp with So this was back in the 70s  late 60s Well actually I probably started going to camp in the mid- to late-60s all the way through early-70s So this is a girl that lives in Canada She was posting things on Facebook because she saw my post and was posting I have a friend that needs rescuing Or she was calling people she knew I have lots of friends-Q:Wow From CanadaT:From Cana  well she grew up in  I think she grew up in Minnesota But I have friends from camp that lived  so shes from Canada Theres a bunch in Chicago Theres a bunch in New York And there are just all sorts of posts of people passing my post on or  I know somebody that needs help And some of them are acquaintances but friends or friends of friends that see the post I was just flabbergasted So we got rescued on Tuesday morning Probably from Tuesday that morning sometime all the way for three or four days we had somewhere between half a dozen to a dozen  I dont remember  different rescue organizations that called and said Have you been rescued yetQ:Right Weve been hearing that-T:People put our names  I dont even know who And I dont even know which organizations But people put our names on various organization rescue lists And-Q:Yeah and so people were following up to be sure that youd been rescued If you find anything  this is the phone number that you could actually  you can text them or you can do screen shotsS:Thats what I was going to do I was going to do a screen shot of thisQ1:If you have AirDrop on your phone we can AirDrop them Its like a S:Okay so I have  this was a post  this was a couple of days before we were actually flooded I posted thisQ1:Yeah that would be awesome So if you screen shot thatS:Update  were in trouble The Barker Reservoir cannot hold any more water The Army Engineers release water That was two days before we were floodedQ:Thats very helpful because it gives us kind of the idea of where the starting point was and then how people started to kind of spread your message to then get you ultimately  learn about how you were rescuedS:So I dont know how to AirDrop I can take a screen shotQ1:Yeah and then Ill show you how to AirDropS:So I go to the photo And I take the photo-Q1:And you hit like youre going to send a text except this S:AirDropQ1:And then you should see our name And then I just got it right hereT:He got itS:I know It says waiting Sent So now Ive got a bunch moreQ1:Feel free to screen shot And you can take your timeQ:Go ahead as were talkingT:Would that be easier than taking-Q1:This works fineT:Sometimes pictures of screens dont work as wellQ1:Im getting really good right nowQ:Were fortunate  its a pretty decent phone even though its a little bit older of a phone Its worked well for the project So you started  you got the word out here People from literally all over are forwarding your message And even after you were rescued people were still calling you to be sure that you were rescued So how did it happen that someone came to rescue youT:So over the previous couple of days they said  If you need help being rescued put a white sheetS:Yeah I saw that in the commentsT:But put a white sheet out your window And that way as people are going down your street theyll know So I wanted to make sure that they would see so I went up to our second floor We have two screens on all the windows so I took a pair of scissors Because he said How are you going to put a sheet out Weve got screens I said I dont care Im going to cut a hole in the screen I need to get out of here So I did I cut a bit hole and the holes still thereS:The hole is still there in the screenT:Im trying to get somebody to come fix it And I took one of my sons sheets and I tied it to the cord on the blinds because I didnt know how else to do it I wanted to leave the window open so I could hear if somebody was calling us I did I just hung itS:I posted this I was sharing Terris post Its Tuesday 5:30 am One of my friends from the office  Can anyone get to this area and help Sam ____ and Terri ____ We need help ASAPQ1:So it sounds like you guys  and just looking through your posts  it sounds like you guys have very strong social networks People reshare-S:Well all of my friends at workQ:Yeah what type of work do you doS:Insurance and investment planningT:Life insurance not property and casualty Life disabilityQ1:But some of these posts are getting hundreds of likes and shares This post has 40 comments on it It sounds like theres just an outpour-T:Are you still on that  oh just a different oneQ1:Im just on August 29th tooT:So it just  it just over the years weve connected with a lot of people So theres some of our kids  not a lot of our kids friends because I will-[OVERLAPPING]T:Ill only accept  I wont go and ask my kids friends But if they ask me then I would accept So we have that We have friends of friends I grew up in Houston so very well connected that wayQ:So after you hung the white sheet out who then ended up coming and rescuing you What was kind of that storyS:AustinQ:Somebody from AustinS:Two guys-T:Total strangersS:They looked like they came out of what  T:The swampsQ:They did ReallyS:Whats the television showQ:I know Duck huntersS:Something like that Or Swamp Masters or whatever Two guys with big beards and they had their air boat from Austin TexasT:Two guys from Austin They just  from what we understand people were lining the highways with boats and stuff And they came in They were going down the neighborhood They  as soon as I heard the noise I ran to the window We need help Water wasnt really coming in We had a few little bitty puddles coming in the house but really nothing at that pointQ:You got a picture of themT:Yeah he doesS:The rescue guys They came in from Austin See this guy with the big beardQ:Oh my gosh It looks like theyre kind of [16:28] partT:They just look like country bumpkinsS:Im going to send that little postQ1:Thats be greatS:Rescue guys They came in from AustinT:They had their air boat They had ear phone  because air boats are loudS:Theyre really loudT:So they had ear muffs or whatever you call them I dont know what you call them And we walked out Ahead of time I had packed  we had all packed bags So I packed one bag for me  and we have two dogs So I packed a bag of dog food You hear all this stuff so I did I packed dog food and their dog bowls And one is a Pembrook Welsh Corgi  so hes little 30-35 lbs Little short legs And the other is a Rhodesian Ridgeback Boxer mix So hes bigger 50 lbs And we had carried the Corgi to the boat because it was way too deep And then the other one the bigger dog Dani she got scared So somebody ended up lifting her and carrying her out And they put us on and they were  the dogs were petrifiedS:I cant send you guys videos I dont think I canQ1:Yeah you can AirDrop videosS:I can AirDrop videos too AlrightQ1:I think Ive got most of everything posted on  from your accountS:Ill just AirDrop one video to you  not all of themQ1:Thats great Ill close thisT:Okay Thats fine Can I say a bad word on thereQ:Absolutely You can say whatever you want Ive heard just about everythingQ1:Yeah weve heard a lotT:Its not really bad bad But anyway so the dogs  we get up the morning and let them out And the water was already to the back door And we werent thinking But we let them out in the back yard We werent thinking  but they didnt  the went out and then they immediately came back in And so obviously they didnt go to the bathroom So by the time we got rescued it had been from the night before that they had gone out So we get on the boat and Dani the bigger dog she literally was scared shitless and she dumped on the S:On the platform of the boatQ:Im sure thats trueT:It just petrified her And  Q:And they just took it in stride And you just made it workT:I kept saying Im sorry Im sorry They said Dont worry about it We get to the drop off point and they cleaned it and its no big deal We were holding onto them with their leashes and collars because I just knew they were going to try to jump offQ:Whats the trick Whats the trick on videoS:I already got itQ1:Yep I got itS:The video there I cannot take credit for this but these statistics are mind-boggling This is from Channel Two news  Im going to  but just for a little bit of drama here So it does click to Houston So total amount of water  9 trillion gallons fell from the sky And they said How much is 9 trillion gallons It would feel the Great Salt Lake twice It equals 9 days of Mississippi River flow So thats like the Mississippi River flowing into that area for 9 days Heres my favorite one  I mean not favorite But you remember Katrina New Orleans It would cover New Orleans in 128 feet of water Im doing the screen shot right nowQ1:Is that something you shared  did you share that on FacebookS:Yeah I shared that on FacebookT:He got it off of Click Two  and their website I guess Or somebody else shared it or somethingQ:So considering that you were rescued by someone who was in the neighborhood rescuing people and all of these other folks had shared your post all over the place explain to me the value of having all those people sharing your post even though you were rescued kind of a different wayT:Very valuable Very I mean I cant tell you how important it was how much  how good it made us feel that people from all over the-S:If we had not been rescued at that point in time when would have been rescuedT:Eventually Eventually we would have been rescued We would have been totally fine because with only 4 inches of water  our neighborhood never lost power Ever When we went back  Sam went back the next day with our son A boat took him back in But there were people that stayed that never left our neighborhood And their electricity never went off When we left we turned ours off because thats what they said to do So we never  the neighborhood never lost electricity So we would have been fine had we stayed But you dont know You dont know You hear all these stories where the water comes to your ceiling and then they have to go to the second floor  and then it goes up Who knows Wouldnt really imagine it would have been like that but you dont know what youre thinkingQ:Right And there were people who did experience that So thats definitely trueQ1:So it sounds like that even though you were rescued the people who rescued you may not or may have used your social mediaS:We dont knowQ1:But it sounds like using social media was a good almost coping mechanismT:It was It helped to know that people were seeing our post were looking out for us were trying to help I think what they did  because I didnt put my name on those rescue lists Somebody else did I didnt put my name on any list because I wasnt thinking like that So my mode was Facebook because I knew between myself my husband his friends our sons  one lives here One lives in New York All their connections  and theyre both your age Youre a little older But theyre very well connectedQ:Did you ever call 9-1-1S:Never called 9-1-1T:And I dont think we did because I figured  hate to say it kind of figured it was futile That for them to put our name on a list when all these hundreds of thousands of people needed  I thought we would be so far down Maybe thats wrong thinking but we didntQ:No thats really helpful because I am curious  did you know at that time that people were having trouble with 9-1-1 or was that-S:No We had no ideaT:We had no ideaQ:Thats helpful to know too and to understand kind of how people view these resources Ive heard things very similar to that before so that makes sense So let me see-S:So I dont want to share  it would be too difficult to share this with screenshots-T:And email thread I mean a text threadS:A text thread between myself and our younger sons high school drama teacher Weve remained friendly Jackie was putting stuff up on Facebook I said  Didnt want to answer on Facebook but were in trouble with a combination of the Barker Reservoir being released along with nonstop rain Our subdivision is flooded No way to get out except by boat Water getting close to our front door Well have to go upstairs soon Hopefully we can get a boat out here tomorrow morning Oh Sam  this is her  Oh Sam Can I alert anyone The National Guard is in Katy Can I call them for you What is your address Can we put out on Facebook your address with a request that a boat come help There are some private citizens coming around in boats to help people And they Terri says  Its me my sister her 9-year old granddaughter My address is  what is your address I have a friend who might  and my two dogs Sending them my address May I also put it on Facebook I said  Absolutely What is the cross-street Off Frye Road at Perdido Bay  Perdido Bay turns into Lochmare Lane They said  Get ready because help is coming I said  Thanks Jackie This was back on August 28th at night And then it goes on She basically kept in touch She text me  Did they make it there yetT:If you know a way that he can-S:Its a whole streamQ1:Youre saying it verbally right now So thats also just as important Later these interviews will be transcribedS:She sends a picture Are they there yet Heres a link And then  In case they didnt make it yet she sent a picture of the boat Christopher never called Weve got water coming in the house I just woke up  Has anyone come yet I got these PMs It just went on and on Finally at the very end here  she keeps  different people Tonya Shes now getting in touch with Tonya to help Tonya Getting ready to start up again this morning They had to stop for dark So shes trying to find  Okay so finally another option is to go to Texas Navy On rescue boat now And she says  So relieved Be safe So that was the end of the text threadQ:Wow So you were texting and you were videoing even while you were on the rescue boat RightT:He videoedS:I videoed yeahQ:And you didnt lose your phone Your phone didnt get wet or anything like thatS:No no no noQ:So you were fortunateT:When we were rescued it was really only sprinklingS:Right And the deepest the water was was about waist deep when we got out in front of the houseT:In front of the house I think it S:Close to waist deepT:No it wasnt thatS:Sweetie it had to have beenT:In the front of the house but not where they  they kind of pulled up on the grassS:Right so maybe thigh deepT:Yeah thigh deepQ1:Its still highT:It was high But as we went out of the subdivision at the corner of Frye Road and Westheimer Parkway there was a white pickup truck in the streetS:All you could see was the roofT:I mean you could see maybe 2 inches of the roof of that pickup truck So in that intersection-S:Frye Road was really deep Four or five feet maybe even six feet deep in partsT:In some points Because then at some point the truck got covered It was just  lots-Q:So as they boated you out where did they drop you off and what happened at that pointS:There were two stops Because the boats were not able to go to real shallow water there was one stop at McMeans Junior High School  thats where they dropped us off but there was still waterT:Thats where the water started to kind of slack offS:But there was  so over at McMeans Junior High School they had these Army trucks that  the beds were probably this high So you had to actually climb up into the bed We get to McMeans Junior High School and we climb up into the bed of the truck and the truck takes us in the street which is also still full of water but not enough water that a boat could get in it And he took us further up Westheimer Parkway to Exley Elementary And there is where our son and my nephew picked  well our son picked me and Terri up with our two dogs  because we were going to his house And then my nephew picked up my sister and her granddaughter So his mom  my nephews mom and his niece  yeah niece  and took them their wayQ:And had yall coordinated before you were rescued to know where you were going to goS:Yes We had to know where we were going to be going We had to know we were going to Exley Oh no no no no Im sorry We didnt know When we got there we called them and said Hey were at Exley Come get us thereQ:And they were able to  those were drop off points where people could drive in rightS:Im sorryQ:People could drive in to those final pointsS:Yes Exley Elementary was not  there was no water on the street in front of Exley ElementaryT:My house has been exposed I dont careS:Lets see Ill just scroll one at a time I guessQ:Are yall  are yall back inS:No Not yet Hopefully another six weeksT:So they have finished building all of our cabinets throughout the kitchen the utility room the study the master bathroom and the master closet So thats all done So the next is painting and then all the tilework floors and bathroom and then wood floorsQ:Ive heard though that things are going pretty slowly for most people rightT:It is going slow but I consider ourselves very lucky in that our contractor has people that hes  hes working on five houses So hes just moving them from house to houseS:And I helped him out by recommending  I helped him out by recommending a guy who could put in wood floors that we knew My niece had a guy that put in granite  granite countertops Hes using that guy Another Q:Boy the power of networks is pretty unbelievable even for rebuilding And yeah this whole project has really changed my view in terms of how important it is to stay connected to peopleT:Its going slow But its going Now really up until probably late November  maybe even early-December the only thing wed really had done on the house was cleaning outS:That was kind of depressing Up until December So from August 29th until December we didnt see anything but destruction No progressT:I kind of likened  because everybody  you take everything out of your house and you put it on the front curb And my best way to describe it is all my undergarments are sitting on the front curb So its all my personal stuff  not necessarily underwear and that kind of stuff but its just all stuff thats in your house that normally people wouldnt see and its just all out there for the world And then you had people coming in and going through that stuff and taking whatever they saw Some people  some people were asking Can I take this Can I take that It was like If you really want it take it I dont care And some people were coming by and just taking Because the neighborhood would empty out totally at night So people would come by in the evening when nobody was around And we ended up  our neighborhood got security because were not a gated community So they put security in the neighborhood and  knock on wood  weve never had through all this nothing really bad security-wise has happenedQ:Did yall  you were able to keep your phones charged and there wasnt ever any concern about losing battery or anything like thatS:No because like Terri said water started coming in at 5:30 in the morning We were on a boat already at 9:45Q:So what things didnt work well in terms of communication Where did you see breakdowns or anything like thatS:In communication withQ:With  it could be with either people rescuing with family and friends  were there any officials there like fire or police or-S:Not in the neighborhood But when we got dropped off at the rescue points there were  the Army was there the fire department was thereQ:Okay so you really didnt see much It just seemed to work pretty wellT:Yeah we really didnt have  I didnt see that much lack of communication Im not sure that they were totally forthcoming on the  government officials about the flooding and what it would do when the opened the reservoir And then of course I think they said they were going to open one at 2:00 and one at the next day and they ended up doing both at basically the same time So I think in some of those but it wasnt direct communications with usQ:Did yall feel like you were ever  were you ever notified that you needed to evacuateS:That was the sticking point there The only indication from anybody that we might have to evacuate was from a neighbor a couple of doors down who sent a text or email or something saying  theres a pretty good chance were going to be flooding But that was it Everything on the news  our neighborhood never never once had a mandatory evacuation It had a voluntary evacuation but not a mandatory evacuation And that didnt even  by the time that even came out Frye Road was so flooded that we wouldnt be able to get out anyway So the part that really upsets us a lot is we were never informed It wasnt on our plat  it wasnt anywhere where we were buying a house in a flood poolT:We bought our house in 92 And back in then they say they started putting it on the plats or the deeds or whatever in the late 90sS:I think it was 96T:Thats what the attorneys have said So we are participating in the class action lawsuitS:Its not costing us anything Attorneys are spending all their money  theyre very confident that theyre going to win the case We dont know how much if anything were going to get But I mean the fact is that we were wrongedQ:And Im assuming you didnt live in a flood plain so you dont have flood insuranceS:We did have flood insurance One of  two out of ten 20% in our neighborhood  20% had flood insurance The other 80% did notT:Fifteen years ago our insurance agent said I suggest you get it You dont have to Its not required I suggest  I asked her how much it wasS:$400 and somethingT:No back 15 years ago it was $250S:A yearT:So I did it And Ive just been doing it And this past year it was $450 But thats like nothing Even though  you really dont know what it will do for you But I thought  Okay $450 Its not that big of a deal So I paid that  for 15 yearsS:Our neighbor across the street  I wont mention his name  our neighbor across the street did not renew his flood insurance in JuneQ:Ive heard this a lotS:And two months later we get floodedQ:I have heard  thats unbelievable And Im sure that those people maybe share that widely Thats why Ive heard that multiple times Oh thats got to be hard on people So a couple of other kind of general questions So what were your perceptions of the rescue effort in generalS:Amazing Thats one word that I could use is amazing It was  it boggled my mind even after the day after we were rescued when Graham my son  when my son and I went back to the school to Exley to see  I mean people were already rescued But to see boats  dozens of boats sitting out there waiting for people like me so that we can go back to our house assess damages and  so they took us in so we could assess They let us grab some stuff We put as much as we could grab on the boat and then they took us back out There were literally dozens of boats waiting to help people go back to their homes to assess damages to see if maybe they could grab some things and then they would take them backT:And we did hear a lot of stories about volunteers  their boats were destroyed because they would hit things hidden in the waterS:Fire hydrants They would tear up the bottom of their boatT:Anything that was covered by water They didnt know what was thereS:Fire hydrants did the most damageT:Because they always had that little post sticking upS:And they dont budge Its not the mailbox Okay I went over the mailboxQ:Thats so true As a boat owner myself I can just imagine That would be petrifying to not know whats under you the whole timeT:I think the majority  the majority of the rescues were done by volunteers not government agencyQ:Right Its pretty amazing what the community did So you had mentioned  one of my other questions is  Has your social media habits changed any after this And you had mentioned not really but you had joined one additional groupT:The only group I added was NextDoor I did add that one And thats how I saw the post about this Through the NextDoor I dont look at it a lot because a lot of it is just a  I dont think its stupid what some people put in there Its kind of like Facebook Its stupid what some people put inS:On Facebook  I walked my dog this morning and he was very happy OkayT:But it did show me about that And in the first few days  first couple of weeks after the flooding NextDoor was somewhat helpful in just kind of seeing what people were doing Now its not And I have not  I still dont do Twitter or any of those kinds of things Its just Facebook is really the only thing that I doQ:That is great So the last kind of couple of questions  is there anything we havent asked that you think might be helpfulT:As far as social media-wise S:I can tell you Facebook and text messages  those two thingsQ:They seem to be the main thing So the last thing is if yall wouldnt mind Ill have you just kind of both together kind of fill this out Theres just four demographic questions So what Ill do is Ill make a note that theres a male and a female But if you wouldnt mind filling that out I would sure appreciate that And then the other thing is we could either give you a pseudonym or if you have a name that you always wish you had been named but you werent or a favorite name that you couldnt name a childT:I mean if you just want to use  I dont know if you want first and last nameQ:Just a first nameT:You can use TerriQ:Well come up with something for you We dont mind coming up with something We just try to not Q1:But some people find it really fun to be able to pick a nameS:By socio-economic status youre talking about annual income Is that what youre talking aboutQ1:Give it a thought Some people like to have fun with itQ:Thats rightQ1:But then they pick celebrity names or things like thatQ:Sometimes its kind of silly I have several Bart SimpsonsT:Alright so youre 58S:Thats okay Youre still 58T:My birthday was Friday so Im 59Q:Youre close enoughT:Im 59Q:Oh thats so funny Thats greatT:Theres really nothingQ:OkayT:If yall have questions I am open for yall to contactQ:Thank you That sounds wonderfulQ1:I took this but this is the card-Q:Thats my cardQ1:And then on the back is the email  or the phone number for the project So if you think of things related to this project or perhaps you know somebody that would be interested they can call this number on the back This is our dedicated project phone where youve been sharing info Weve got info from you as wellQ:Great Well thank you all so muchT:So do you want our name phone numberQ:Nope You know what I actually dont even connect it with anything in the data Well give you a pseudonym and then usually I dont even necessarily remember who told us what Because were really looking at pulling all the data together to try to understand a big picture of what-S:Obviously they have our first and last names because theyre on the photosQ1:But those will be de-identified and redacted for research Even the little pictures where  the little circle on Facebook where a little profile picture  we redact all of thatQ:We pull them all off and then we dont ever have to worry We have a dataset where we dont know who contributed whatS:So the actual purpose for this research is strictly about social media or is it -Q:So its a little broader than that And the bulk of what were trying to do is trying to understand what a real call for help looks like and what a real rescue looks like And it just so happens that so much of it took place on social media that thats a large part of what were seeing And we really havent interviewed anybody who used absolutely nothing even if it was text messages But text messaging people have told us  I talked to one person who the bulk of how they communicated was literally they knew everybody on their street and they walked out in their front yard and everybody was talking to each other Thats another important way to know that you can pass information aroundT:Well Im in a book club in our neighborhood And its all just neighborhood people  10 of us And weve been doing this book club for 115 years now So two  three out of the ten have moved away but we still connected And we talk via text message a lot Its just a group text that goes around and just keeps going So we were all talking during that time through group textQ:So thats really the main purpose of this Moving forward what we have recently learned and realized is that we have  theres so much that we could study relating to this to try to help for planning for in the future And for being able to pick out  somebody posts something to social media and can we use computers to go out and look for real calls for help We would love to be able to do that And then the other thing thats kind of emerged out of this thats fascinating is how these volunteer groups started self-organizing sometimes working with official groups and sometimes doing things all on their own And so we have a lot of that in our data as well that well be able to kind of make some sense out of And that  I think the good news is that the word just came out that the State of Texas is actually going to get a pretty sizable amount of federal funds to try to really address some of the planning issues for the futureT:HopefullyS:What they really need to do is they need to dredge these reservoirs up I mean that they need to make them have a lot more capacity for waterQ:Theres going to be a lot of engineering feats that have to take place You said your son was a mechanical engineer Yeah its  were going to have to use a lot of creative thinking in terms of what to do because weve got so much building thats happened in this area Water is going to have to go somewhere in the futureT:It has to go somewhere rightQ:So itll be that type of research But were also hoping that theyre going to deal with the social side of things too And so were social scientists even though I have a biochemistry background before I became a social scientist Im very interested in how people deal with these situations and how we help each other through social media So thats the goalT:So you as a student-Q1:Im a doctoral studentT:For communicationsQ1:Yeah This is my  well shes my doctoral advisor but also my boss on this project too But Ive been learning a lot My research interest is about social media and social media use Ive kind of crafted it through this project because Ive been a part of this since the beginning Social media has been used so differently among people who are rescued these kind of emergent volunteer groups And then the official sources use social media in completely different ways Everybody has a purposeS:How old are youQ1:How old am I 25S:25 So hes-T:Youre younger than our two kidsS:Yeah I was thinking  were Aggies  I say were Aggies I went to Florida We have a nephew and another distant relative who both worked on the field in the football games with Bevo And one with Bevo and one with the cannonQ:Oh wow So he did  hes really an interesting grad student for our program because he has worked with two of the people who went through the PhD program with me So its kind of crazy Ive never gotten to have somebody that literally has had two of my friends who were trained like I was for his undergrad and his masters And so he has two more years left in our program at UT and then hell be Dr RobertsonQ1:Well my grandparents were from Florida originally They both went to University of FloridaS:Did they really OkayQ1:Moved to California in the late 50s So Ive lived out  before moving to Texas Ive lived out in CaliforniaS:I was in Florida from 76-80Q:You know we flew out  T and I did  to Florida and we met with all their emergency communication centers And we know a fair bit now about how Florida plans for hurricanes And-Q1:Its completely different What happens  on a state level in Florida  because when natural disasters strike it affects the entire state Florida is a thin state so everybody is moving quicklyS:Well I was supposed to go  this was two years ago I think  I was supposed to go to a Florida-LSU game in Gainesville And there was a hurricane that was threatening the east coast So they cancelled the game And all the LSU people were really really upset about this saying You guys are just afraid to play us this that and the other And the thing is when you have hurricane  oh and the day of the game it was sunny it was beautiful Theyre saying Oh yeah you guys are… The thing is when you have an event that could happen everybody has to go somewhere so all of the hotel rooms in Gainesville were occupied They couldnt  so there was no room for anybody to come in from out of town for the game And so  anyway And whats kind of ironic is adjusters  insurance adjusters were coming in from all over the country to Houston because there was so many  for the flood And the guy  the adjuster that came to see us was from Florida And he also got flooded during their hurricaneQ:He got flooded in Florida Are you seriousT:Yeah the one in Florida S:The one that was right after oursT:Two weeks after ours  IrmaQ:Sorry Irma ReallyS:Yeah the guy that came to our houseQ:Okay was he in TallahasseeS:No noQ:What is the other place we went to JacksonvilleT:I think it was JacksonvilleS:It might have been JacksonvilleQ:Was he from JacksonvilleT:No because he was on the Gulf CoastS:TampaT:The Tampa areaQ1:They got affected in some ways but for Florida theyre used to storms and weather-T:I think he got it more from storm surgeS:He was right on the coastT:He was right on the beachQ:Yes thats what they told us that thats their big issue with flooding The only other place that weve been able to find in Florida  because we actually wanted to do a few interviews of people who were flooded in Florida to see what some of the differences were Jacksonvilles been the main area where weve seen they have flooding So wow that isS:I dont know how many years ago this was  several years ago when Florida had like five or six threaten  I dont know if they all hit but five or six And you know a map of the United States  so there was a joke in one of the Florida newspapers that says  Weve moved And they took Florida off and they stuck it between Minnesota and Wisconsin The State of Florida they just stuck it in there Weve moved Were goneQ:Well whenever it hits they move out of the state So they do  they evacuate usually when they realize that they need to do that So alright Well thank you all again We really appreciate itS:And its KeriQ:Its Keri K-E-R-IS:K-E-R-IQ:Like the hand lotion Keri hand lotion  remember Keri hand lotion I really was named after thatT:Oh reallyQ:My parents were arguing over what to name me and my mother wanted to name me India after her favorite soap opera character And my father wanted to name me Ruby And my mother has a temper and she picked up a bottle of whatever was beside her and threw it at the wall and said I dont care Name her after a stupid bottle of hand lotion And Im Keri Im so glad that was not Jergens or I could be Jergie sitting here today So it could be a lot worse But thats literally how I got my name You can just go a lot of places with that Its pretty scary Well thank yall againTRANSCRIBERS NOTE: That is hysterical I went to a Rick Springfield concert in Vegas back in 02 and there was a girl he picked out of the audience to come up to the stage whose name was Keri Keri like the lotion  thats what she told him And then she got a phone call from her mom while she was up on the stage with him She was hysterical Its my favorite memory of that night Not the concert  though it was awesome  but Keri like the lotionEND OF RECORDINGAnn SharpQ:Hi were talking with Ann And Ann was rescued in Hurricane Harvey from your apartment rightA:My brothersQ:From your

hearing people talk Id get up open the slide door look out and then I laid down and I began to pray And after I prayed then I heard some noise again and I opened the slide door up And it was about 3:00 in the morning And it was some guys They had on orange vests And they were like  I said Are you all here to help They said Do you all want to be rescued I said Yes sir So when they came up the stairs water was just coming all in the apartment Im looking trying to move stuff And then I was like Lets go And my brother was like We going And then a lady came there and she asked my brother Stay

a ladder but we need a blanket to tie him down So my daddy was like  he didnt want to go So I said OK So they told me to walk slow and they said The only thing you can take was two things in your hand You had to have them up in the air So when I left the water was at my waist So I had to walk slow with my hands in the air with only two things  two stuff that I could pack And they was in like an Army truck And then we left there They took us to the store And from there a bus picked us up and took us to the MET Church on 1960 and Jones Road And then they came back and they said everybody had

I seen the water It happened so quick sweetheartQ:I know Thats what I heardA:This is what I cooked before This is what I had cooked that same day And all this food we ate one time And all the food  I had to throw it  it had to get thrown away I had made this on my brothers stove And let me tell you what they did at  thats FEMA This is my  this is what happened at the MET This is the MET My granddaughter  my grandbaby was with me This is what they did at the MET They did all this for the kidsQ:Oh my gosh Thats so amazingA:This is at the METQ:Thats wonderful that they did thatA:This is a big old  and this is all the stuff that they had This is what they fed usQ:And they fed you foodA:Yeah They fed us thatQ:You should take  this is interesting Grab  take a picture of the food Because I think that that was really important to  here youre displaced and people are coming in to entertain the kids and then also to feed youA:That was some stuff that they gaveQ:Thats just so wonderful that people were willing to do that So let me ask you about your daughter So you sent her these pictures Did she ever post them on anythingA:Yeah she posted on FacebookQ:She posted on Facebook Was that before you were rescued or afterA:I think after This is how it looked at that dayQ:Thats beforeA:This is how it looked that day And I posted it on Facebook And I was like We blessed because no water came here Then I went outside and I posted again This was the same day Then later on I was embarrassed to post it but my daughter  this was when it started raining And then thats when I was embarrassed Then I think my brother had got [00:12:51] This is my brothers house before it took off He left his fishes in there  his fish aquarium and all thatQ:So Im really curious You said you were embarrassed to post on FacebookA:Yeah I was because I was saying I was blessed because the rain hadnt started But all of a sudden that rain just came like that I mean  and my brother was in shock He called my kids and said You know what I dont know what I wouldve did if it wasnt for your mother Because I have nine kids I have nine kids And they  he told me B you know what I really thank you he said because  youve been in this before I said No I got nine kids and I just know what to do automatically And he thanked me because he was in shock He was sitting on the couch in shockQ:And weve definitely heard that I mean thats a pretty normal reaction that some people haveA:Yeah and I  because he  you know you would see it on TV You would see people talk about it But until it happens to you you aint going to know what [00:13:52] People can say I wouldve done this I wouldve did that But if you aint there you dont know what you wouldve doneQ:Im with you there My third  when I was in the third grade our house was five feet of water in it So I was a child but youre right You cant  unless youve been through it you dont understand Let me grab  I have a few more questions for you And Im kind of curious what  do you mind if I catch some general information about you  demographicA:NoQ:So could you do me a favor and just quickly fill this out for me One of the things that Im really trying to do is make sure that we get people who represent lots of different ethnicities and income levels that are all a part of our studyA:This is what incomeQ:Yes Thats under $15000 thats $15000-$30000 OK Perfect OKA:And the cold part about it  my apartment  the apartment that I was living in Bryan flooded and FEMA wouldnt even help me They said it wasnt a disaster Water came through the shower through the toilet Flooded it I left My son went there and took the carpet and stuff up Told him I dont want it So now Im homelessQ:Are you able to live with familyA:YeahQ:OK Wow So I have a question for you Theres a lot of different things about our mobile phones that people talk about being important in disasters And so theres some words that we have in our literature that relate to this And I cant find that single sheet for some reason But well find that next Im kind of curious Do any of these words like locatability or reachability  was it important that people could reach you whenever you were tryingA:Oh yes it was Because my son called me And I was devastated because he was on Tidwell and  Tidwell and  northwest side at the  and they wouldnt even get them They couldntQ:They couldnt get to themA:They have three kids They couldnt get to him He said Mama we going to die I could hear him walking through the water I said Go to upstairs Go to somebody upstairs Call upstairs Mama I dont want to go in them peoples house People was getting mad because people was coming upstairs And the Army truck couldnt even get over there The water was too highQ:Yeah How  were they OKA:People were breaking in They broke in Fiesta They broke in the pawn shop They broke in Ross They would go and get food The police couldnt even get them because why The water was too high Police car was even  had it parked to scare people They broke the window out the police car The guy had it on camera where they were going into the pawn shop and the hair store They took everything out the hair store People was in boats stealing stuff It was horrible over there They took this guy go kart My son said he seen it This guy pulled a gun on him The guy gave him the go kart When the guy made it from there to there the go kart stop And he told him Dont you come Had to take off and leave the guy  the guy tried to start it it wouldnt work so he had to leave it hisselfQ:So its probably  people probably couldnt tell who was there to rescue people and who was there to break inA:They couldnt They couldnt rescue nobody They had  where my son was on Tidwell all the way probably to 45 they couldnt get down there I have a first cousin that live on 1960 She said she went 45 to something She couldnt get down there where my son was to rescue himQ:Now were they OKA:Yeah it came out they was OK But all of them had infections They had to go to the hospital  the kids and him and herQ:So let me ask So reachability was really important Was it important that you had the multimedia capability  like the fact that you had the camera in your phone and all these different thingsA:Right It was good I had thatQ:And the fact that you could carry it with you  that it was portableA:Right mm-hmmQ:Alright What about the fact that things are still there on your phone Is that still importantA:YesQ:OK alright And the fact that you could change it if you needed to  modify it add to it  was that importantA:Mm-hmm yeahQ:And then what about  let me see I think thats pretty much the main things that we have that are on there Did you use any  do you have any apps on your phoneA:Yeah I doQ:You do What kind of apps do you haveA:I just have like download apps where I like Q:Did you use anything to post pictures I guess I should be more specificA:Well my daughter didQ:OK your daughter did it all for youA:Yeah I sent them to her Because what I did is I told my daughter I said Look Im in danger I need help My daughter live in Katy on 529 I called her and said Look its going to flood Go to my daughter  go to your sisters house in Bryan She listened to me She took off She went to Bryan  she went to College Station So I called her about  I texted 2:00 in the morning Look Im in danger I need help The waters coming in here She didnt answer the phone That morning she called me She said Mom is you OK Im sorry I was asleep So she posted  she said This is what my mom and my uncle is going through right now She posted it on Facebook And then like I said I was fixing to call 9-1-1 if those guys wasnt there They was trying to sleep Honey I couldnt sleep because I wasnt fixing to drown in that water And then when I got ready to leave the devil said Your daddy and your brother going to die And I was wiping my tears and wiping and I kept looking back And I was fixing to tell them to stop But I said I thought about that alligator that man seen I said That alligator going to get me And they not fixing to walk me back to my apartment and I got to walk through this water And then you got to  its scary because you had to like feel your way you knowQ:Wow Thats true yeahA:Because I knew if I really didnt know that apartment I probably wouldve fell down Because that water was coming And with my hands in the air  and Im diabetic too and I fall anyway  I had to  he talking about Keep up No I got to feel my way I know where the sidewalk at and I know its a step down And if I step down I might fall So I had to look And then we had to wait They was rescuing dogs I mean it was terribleQ:Wow Do you think anybody saw the Facebook post that your daughter put And do you think that that helped them come rescue you all at all Or were they just in that areaA:They was in that area They had to because guess what We right by the police stationQ:OK They knewA:The police station right hereQ:Yeah location mattersA:And the houses right here This the police station and this the apartment And the fire and the ambulance That five  I mean that  what you call it The ambulance and the apartments They knew to get us We was blessed because we was right there by the resource right there by Right thereQ:You were Oh my gosh thats really amazingA:So they had already Q:Yeah So is there anything else that you want to add Because I want to be sure that when they actually call you we can get you back out thereA:Well I did call a rescueQ:You didA:Mm-hmm for my son We had to put it on Facebook But if we didnt have no phone how in the world was they going to find him And a guy got killed trying to rescue over there where my son live He drowned He was an assistant pastor He drowned Sure did And he was like We trying to get to everybody And then on Facebook oh my God The posts that was on Facebook had me crying People were  people had to get a pillowcase and put in there black writing HelpQ:And put it in their windowsA:Put it outside And they were getting them in a length of time People  a woman and child died Two people was  a woman and a child went into the thing came out on the other end They both died A son was out there trying to  his son was out there in the water playing He was trying to get him He went into the suction hole He got him outQ:ReallyA:Yeah Then he fell in He died They couldnt get himQ:And this all happened in this area in KatyA:Mm-hmm And they got a lot of pictures on FacebookQ:I know that they do Where in particular did you look on Facebook to see those kind of picturesA:You just go to different people page and you will see it you

(00:28:15)Gary EnergyQ:And then the last thing is I tryI let you select a pseudonym So who would you like to be called and it can beA:Sharon mentioned that we should come up with one and I totally forgotQ:No anything is fine I always say its something that you know who knows maybe you wish you were named or a name of a friend that you really like or something like that usually works greatA:Is it alright if I think about that one and by the end of theQ:Its totally fine Well come back and we will add that inA:FantasticQ:So yeah I am kind of curious Tell me about where you were and how this all happened for youA:So I wasnt sure if you would have a lot of questions or if you would just want me to sort of give a chronology of what happened I can do it that wayQ:That would be greatA:SoQ:I see that youthank you so much this is great when you bringIm increasingly fascinated by the role that maps played for yall YeahA:I think for me its easier to explain if I have a map in front of meQ:Okay greatA:So we live in a neighborhood called Barkers Landing Its a few miles west of here right near I-10 and Highway 6 So heres I-10 heres 6 Right now were somewhere over here Never gave much thought to this before but were right at the confluence for the two reservoirs Addicks and Barkers So they were released right intoright on both sides of us And this map these maps were put out by the Army Corps of Engineers Supposedly these were always publicly available but I never saw them until after I guess thats when you start looking Its maximum probably inundation map and I don't know about these sharp lines but in this area at least its actually pretty close to what happenedQ:Thats so interesting that that is whatsomebody might have just sent me a picture Ill set that over there so it doesnt buzz on usA:It wasit might have been mineQ:Okay Huh you called this a Maximum Probability…A:I think the Army Corps Engineer called it the Maximum Probable Inundation MapQ:Wow interestingA:And just for referenceat least in this areaI know this because when we bought our first house I remember this The 500-year flood plain comes to right about here And currently we live here in Barkers Landing We moved last year from Fleetwood where we have our old house the red one here And its currently awell were currently rebuilding it but in a few weeks hopefully it will again be a rental property rented out to a couple the Kuznitzovahs[00:02:43] Uri and Natalia So yeah you can kind of see what happenedQ:And that was what about 5 A:We got about 2  but 5 -6 thats about as high as it got in the deepest in the area Q:But it was also there for about two weeks rightA:Yes So I don't know the best way to go through Well this is kind of setting the scene We live here Our old housethe rental propertyis here The couple I helped evacuate which I guess when I get into the story lives here And then a lot of news coverage of the flooding in West Houston and impact of the releases wasthe news crews were all set up right here because east of here along this roadMemorial Driveeverything was flooded This is as far as the news trucks could get This is also where all the rescuers from the volunteers to the Coast Guard and the Cajun Navy and everyone this is where they put their boats inYou can see on a percentage wise basis Fleetwood was pretty heavily impacted These other neighborhoods Marywood and Memorial Thicket every single house flooded And then Barkers Landing we fared relatively well I think about 15% of the homes were flooded But I guess there wasnt nearly as well organized of a rescue effort there because there was kind of a small group staging rescues from this point inside the neighborhood but it wasnt very visible compared with this being a major road where somehow all the news crews knew thats where to goSo yeah I guess this is kind of a timeline of the actual storm but as far as how we used social media it all started with preparing for the storm One other thing I should note all of these notes that I put together are about specifically the use of Nextdoor in our neighborhoods Once weve finished this if youd like I could briefly discuss kind of a parallel experience My team at work had a WhatsApp group and we all live all over the west side of Houston And we kind of used that to stay in touch mainly to keep tabs on everyone make sure everyone was safe but also to share advice and experiences So I didnt really prepare for that but I could talk a little bit about it after we go through thisQ:YeahA:So I guess I divided this into three sections: preparing for the storm evacuation and the return and cleanup So one neighbor post on Nextdoor Hey this is my first storm big storm big flood since moving to HoustonThis was a few days before it actually hit and we didn't really know what to expectAny tips So people chimed in and mentioned everything from what to include in your emergency kit be sure to fill your vehicle with gas I commented and I think others commented on the importance of keeping the street drains clear because actually since we bought our house in 2013 weve been through three big floods in Houston 2015 2016 and 2017Q:Oh I know yall have been hit Keep talking Im gonna just crank this a tiny bit because its a little chilly in hereA:2015 didn't really impact our part of town much at all 2016 was a bit worse There was quite a bit of street flooding in Fleetwood and a few homes took on water but it was mostlyor our impression was the flooding was due to things like someones garbage can tipped over The lid got sucked onto a drain and the water built upQ:Oh interestingA:So we didn'tafter that experience some homes got a few inches of water but overall we didn't really consider ourselves a flood prone area And I mentioned in this Nextdoor threadand others mentionedbe sure to keep your drains clear Anything that can float away secure it And if its not too much to ask just every few hours scope out the drains nearest your house are any of them blocked and try to stir them up That kind of adviceAnother thing that came up my house is here This road here is Addicks Howell Road just to the westQ:Yeah Ive driven thatA:And theres a ditch along the side You might have noticed its overgrown and nasty or one section of it is The problem isand this is really giving you the details sorry about thatthis areas fine because Fleetwood maintains it This areas fine because Barkers Landing maintains it but theres one street here thats technically not in an HOA so they don'tthey kind of throw up their hands and say Oh its the citys responsibility So I knew that the storm drains emptied into that ditch and I asked Hey weve had talks on Nextdoor about cleaning up this ditch We couldnt quite marshal the support but with the storm about to bear down on us could anyone spare a couple hours and we could get together and clean it out So me and about three or four other people came out with gloves trash bags rakes and at least got the worst of the growth out And for what its worth even during the worst of it that ditch never reached the banks so we think it might have helped someUnfortunately one of the women who helped us her house was one of the first to flood which at the time we just thought well well do what we can Its looking likeI think we were more worried about the wind than the rain We didn't really perceive that the storm would stall right on top of us I think some people sent out prayer requests or Everyone pray for keeping us safe through the storm And yeah I guess when the rain started maybe Friday getting into Saturday we thought well its quite a bit of rain but the streets seem to be handling it well They fill up with a few inches and they drain away People were concerned about roofs gutters local drainage I posted on Nextdoor Hey could I borrow a couple fans from someone because the roof in our rental house leaked over the garage I thought Ill air it out and 24 hours later the house was full of water but…And then I guess two other things as far as preparing for the storm One corner of the neighborhood down here weve noticed for a few months prior to the storm that whenever it rained an inch or twonot even that muchthe streets would flood really quickly It never got close to anyones houses but we thought well it never did that before And then with all the rain we got on Saturday the streets filled up really quickly and it did get close to some houses And we hadsome of us thought that the most probable issue was the storm drain had collapsed somewhere between the neighborhood and the Bayou There was some discussion on Nextdoor Would anyone be willing to chip in for a pump and my neighbor went out and bought a pretty small I guess pump about the size of a generator gas-powered Set it up here with a hose and basically tried to bridge over the collapsed section and send the water to the BayouQ:And yall did all this through NextdoorA:Yes it was all organized through NextdoorQ:Thats super impressiveA:WellQ:I mean good efforts good effortsA:Well our heart was in the right place but even uh I think after about 30 minutes into that effort we realized it was like sucking through a straw It wasnt making a dent in it The same neighbor who had bought the pump hes actually the brother to John Colbertson our congressman in the US House of Representatives and he tells me that heI don't know if you want to mention all this butcalled in a favor and the city brought out a much larger pump and they pumped for a while and they were able to get the water down And I think they basically stayed there pumping until suddenly the Bayou basically the water was starting to go in the wrong direction and then they pulled out But the initial effort to organize that which we thought you know if the rain stops this will maybe save some of us from getting an inch or two into our homes That was all on NextdoorThe last point as far as preparing for the stormand maybe I should start referring to the chronology herethe heaviest rain over our area seemed to be on Saturday We had street flooding We had that whole pumping effort By Sunday there were still a few strong bands of rain but to my recollection it wasnt as bad as Saturday I know the water receded from the streets because I was able to drive across completely dry streets to our rental house to put out those fans that I borrowed I think it was Sunday evening that the Army Corps of Engineers announced that they would be starting the releases and that made us pretty nervous They had done similar releases following the Tax Day Flood of 2016 but they had waited at least a few days after the water had crested and there was plenty of capacity in the Bayous and we thought wheres this water gonna go the Bayous are nearly at their banks Although the rain had stopped and we thought well if they didn't do the releases probably in 12 hours the water would have dropped quite a bitSo weand the other thing that was frustrated is in all their announcements and publicity there were very specific inundation maps forthis map was never shownneighborhood by neighborhood even maybe street by street for the neighborhoods within behind the reservoirs And those were accompanied by voluntary and mandatory evacuation noticesQ:So this is on the other sides rightA:Yes all upstream in these two directionsQ:But not in this area I understand what youre saying yesA:Exactly There was not even a voluntary evacuation issuedQ:Thats what I heardA:I think that there were some vague statements to the effect that Well street flooding will occur They might have said some houses will get water I thoughtdon'twell I would say don't quote me on this but I thought they said If your house didn't flood from all the rain it likely wont flood from these releases All of this was discussed on Nextdoor Those who saw the announcement by the Corps of Engineers repeated this too and there was some discussion Were thinking about leaving Is anyone leaving and the general consensus if I recall correctly was people said Well well stay overnight and maybe well move some valuables upstairs as a precaution and well plan to leave in the morningAnd right around that time Sunday evening most of Fleetwood lost powerQ:Thats what I thoughtA:And we lost power as well Its really frustrating our house and our nextdoor neighbor are apparently on the same grid as Fleetwood Every other house in our part of Barkers Landing kept power I guess the good thing of that is we lost the power right in the midst of one of the last really heavy rain bands but the good thing is we were able to run an extension cord to our neighbors house and at least run our fridge and charge our phonesQ:Oh my goshA:But yeah we went to bed Sunday night feeling pretty uneasy not sure what to expect I believe they at first said they would stagger the reservoir releases do one and then the other and they would only do this one after monitoring how this one went The first thing I read when I woke up was they had begun both releases overnight simultaneously Q:WowA:So yeah now getting into evacuation I think my wife had beenneither of us slept that well I think she was on Facebook and I remember her mentioning one of her friends who lives right around here near our old house but a little bit I guess lower elevation saying water was getting into her house and she was gonna leave And I checked Nextdoor at 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning and some folks living here in Memorial Thicket said Weve got water coming in and that really surprised me because we had had a little bit of flooding in 2016 Memorial Thicket never flooded I know because before we bought this house we almost bought a house right here The only thing worse than dealing with one house flooded I guess would be twoQ:YesA:So yeah on Monday morning lots of people start getting water into their houses and the rescue efforts begin And I think it started with people saying Ive got water coming in can anyone help me get out and a lot of residents in the neighborhood are elderly Its a very mature neighborhood I guess youd say And a lot of people arent on Nextdoor but people were calling for help from theiron behalf of neighbors And it started with just people one by one saying Hey can someone help me and then I think someone posted The Cajun Navy is onsite does anyone need rescue and people started replying to that thread And at one point Sharon started the thread My husband has his boat can anyoneif anyone needs rescue please let us know I assume youve already talked with herQ:I did yeah she wasA:She probablyIm sure she has the best stories out of anyoneQ:Super helpful yesA:She and Kenny are really like the guardian angels of the neighborhood I think theyre gonna get statues at some pointQ:Oh thats awesomeA:So going back to my notes neighbors requested rescue for themselves or others via Nextdoor Some neighbors said Well the waters coming in Weve moved upstairs Don't worry about us but wed like to note that were in our house Q:So they kind of marked themselves as what theyve done Okay A:There was sort of an informal command post here at this point where all the boats were launching And we were when the boat rescue started I think at one point it was Sharon and when she took a break I tried to do this for about an hour and in became overwhelming just trying to keep track of who was going out who was coming back who was out on a boat can we account for everyone whos in their house It was a mess We might need to find a better way to do it Well Lord willing this never happens again but…Q:Exactly A:So yeah some neighbors posted on Nextdoor They couldnt reach 9-1-1 I remember one woman in Memorial Thicket she posted I think on Facebook and Nextdoor Waters 4 in our house We lost power Weve moved to the second floor My sons on a ventilator can someone get us And they were rescued finally but they had tried to call 9-1-1 and that didn'tthey werent able to get through So Kenny was on his boat the Cajun Navy they were on their boats We saw the fire department on jet skisQ:Really I hadnt heard jet skisA:There were lets see there was a big inflatable swan like a pool float There were air mattresses and then a bunch of us were just wading in Some people had waders On Monday morning I went in first to check on the house and the tenants and I started out in shorts and flip flops I was like Oh this waters nasty but Ill just shower afterwards My flip flops got stuck in the mud almost right away so I just carried them And I remember Monday morning I went to my house The water was about eight inches from coming in and at the time it seemed to be pretty stable and the power was even still on And our tenants were there I said Well you may want to think about leaving Youre welcome to stay with us but our powers off They said Our powers still on well stay put And the water was too deep already for them to drive out so they just started moving their valuables upstairs and got ready for the worst I came back again that afternoon two or three oclock and at that point the water was just starting to come in and it didn't show any signs of slowing down in its rate of rising And still they said Well well just keep moving stuff upstairs Well just stay upstairs Hopefully it comes down and we can walk out tomorrow So I helped them shut off all the downstairs breakers and the AC and I said Again the offer stands if you want to stay with us but they wanted to stay putI knew that they were on Nextdoor or they had Nextdoor accounts but they didn't reallyI never saw them post I think they checked it occasionally So yeah I guess that was Monday Tuesday it was pretty much the same story except the water was still rising and we were starting to get pretty nervous at our house We didn't know when it was gonna stop We didn't know if the dams might breach and that was probably you know for all the wonderful things about Nextdoor and social media the worst part of it was it allows unsubstantiated and ultimately false rumors to spread like wildfire At least one someone said The dams breached Another time someone said The waters coming around the end of the Barker Dam which is was coming around the Addicks Dam and actually that ended up being a non-issue I don't even think any homes on the other side flooded but they said Waters rushing around the sides of the Barkers Dam Everybody get out nowQ:And it wasnt trueA:Oh gosh it wasI think a lot of us got a few gray hairs after reading some of that stuffQ:I betA:But in the midst of it you don't know how bad it is and between seeing this happening in our neighborhood where we always felt pretty safe and watching the news Well without power we were mainly watching it on our phones which you know they only show where theres flooding We assumed that like half or 75% of Houston must be underwaterQ:Oh reallyA:Mm-hmm Yeah Q:Thats interestingA:I mean we didn't really know Id kept in touch with some friends Some said Well our streets are flooded Really the majority of people we talked to had at a minimum some street flooding but other said No no everythings fine But we thought you know like this must be terrible if weve got water this bad in an area thats never flooded before This must be all over And it turns out that it was horrible but maybe a few percent of all of the homes in Houston flooded It wasnt as bad as we were thinkingQ:But some neighborhoods were hit 100% others 70% A lot of neighborhoods were devastated on a smaller kind of neighborhood level scaleA:ExactlyQ:Did you take any pictures of when people were evacuating and going outA:I took some picturesQ:Even cleaning out the drainsA:Oh I wish I had It was pouring rain at the timeQ:And thats pretty common yeahA:And actually you know what every time I went out on foot into the water I left my phone behind because I didnt want to drown it So I missed out on some good photo ops unfortunately Lets see I rememberso lets see Im sorry Going back to Monday I went up to the house twice The first time I went to my house the water was about 8 below Then I walked over to the home of our friends who had posted on Facebook or had Facebook messaged my wife and water was coming in And I got there they had about maybe a foot of water in their house The wife and baby had left but the husband had stayed behind and he was moving things upstairs And I asked if he needed any help but he said Oh no Im fineSo I caught aKennys boat was making the rounds and I just hopped on There was a CNN crew on board They were interviewing everyone I don't think I made the cut though I never saw myself in the news And then I went out again as it turned out when the water started to come in So on Tuesday were getting pretty nervous The waters still rising I was interested in helping with rescues but it seemed like there was a tremendous amount of volunteer help We have a 1  year old My wife wasnt too enthusiastic about me going out if it wasnt absolutely necessary And it seemed like in general most of the people who wanted to leave had left at least monitoring the Nextdoor chatter but it wasand I can send a copy of this I think I have the original on my computer These are screenshots from NextdoorQ:That would bethis is perfectA:This is a thread Sharon posted on Tuesday saying Were heading out to rescue with our boat Please let us know if anyone needs rescue So heres someone posting on behalf of their neighbor an elderly woman who I don't think had Nextdoor Q:Thats really helpful Im seeing a lot of that posting on behalf of someone else A:And then I cut it off here accidentally but right up here my neighbor Chris the one who had bought the pump he posted Were ready to go Could you send a boat And I thought wow it must be bad if Chris is leaving because hewhen the water started to come in my house before I walked back to the car I went to check on him and the water was about 6 below And at that point they hadnt even started moving stuff They seemed pretty confident that everything would be okay They were just sitting on their couch watching the news And Chris has athis is kind of an aside but hes our security director for the neighborhood and hes a computer and electrical engineering genius He built a camera system that watches all the entrances to the neighborhoodQ:I heard about thisA:So he was keeping tabs on that and he was actually trying to keep the system online as long as he could And I think when they cut power the battery backups ran out and the cameras died one by one but he got it all running again I think probably the day that we were all able to get back to our homesQ:Thats amazingA:So here he had posted that he was ready to go and as soon as I saw that Im like I better call Natalia and Uri again and implore them to consider leaving And they finally said Yeah I guess we might as well go It doesnt seem like its gonna be coming down any time soon So I just posted that theyre ready to go and theyll probably be waiting with Chris I thought it would make sense that theydI think I suggested to them that they hang out outside with Chris And at one point Chris actually repeated that they were ready to go so I guess they ended up leaving a little bit later They might have had some things to move upstairs and they had their cat they had to pack up But yeah thats how we called for rescueQ:Thats greatA:I saw this message right before Chris message from a neighbor I knew from previous conversation She said she had friends in Barkers Landing Water is coming in the gentleman fell and was having trouble moving And I hadntI had just been staying home this day but I thought well everyone is so busy in Fleetwood All the boats are getting into Fleetwood Barkers Landing as far as I know doesnt have an organized rescue effort Maybe I could at least check on them and see if I could go and get help if nothing else So I drove to this staging area here and there were a few neighbors helping people mostly walk out of their homes And I asked if anyone had heard about the couple at this address who was injured and they said no And our security guard was there and he had a stretcher so a few folks who I guess had been helping people evacuate all day with their air mattress I joined them I led them to the house We had the stretcher Actually wait no I think I told them which house I was going to and I walked in myself And I asked them to follow because they were making other rounds in the area So we got to the house or I got to the house The water was about a foot deep and the gentleman it was an older couple maybe in their mid to late 60s and the wife was Japanese I don't think she spoke much English The gentleman had somehow managed tohe apparently fell downstairs when the water was starting to inch in He was moving valuables upstairs and he went down for his wedding photo and he slipped on the marble floor at the entryway and fell and cracked his tailbone When I got there somehowI don't know howhe had climbed to the top of the stairs and was laying on his back upstairs and was definitely in a lot of pain I told him Help is on the way Theres some folks coming with a stretcher and an air mattress Is there anything I can do to help you get ready to leave and he asked if I could unplug his hard drive and bring it upstairs So I did that and I think grabbed a couple of minor things that he asked if I could put upstairs and then other things they wanted to bring with them and just put in a big trash bag And then the others showed up I think it ended up being me and three others we managed to roll him onto the stretcher And he was really howling It must have been a pretty bad injury And later he mentioned that he was up there for about 12 hours and I don't know if he had calledI forgot to ask him if he had called 9-1-1 and couldnt get through or what I do remember they must have known or heard somehow that rescues were being done because when I got to the house it had a white towel in the window That was I guess the signal that they needed help But we got him onto the stretcher carried him down the staircase and put him on an air mattress And they also hadthe other folksa kayak so we had loaded his wife into the kayak with their bag and weI thought we would go back to where we put in but they said theres someone on Memorial Drive with a truck And I said theres no way the waters 2 deep on Memorial Drive But there was a truck idling in 2 of water and just ready to drive this way and back to dry land And they saidI asked so I could report back to their friend who posted on Nextdoor Where are you trying to go and they told me Methodist Hospital West HoustonOh one other thing I remember just a detail they didn'tlike I said they were an older couple They didn't have Smartphones They had a flip phone and I asked themwhen we were about to carry him downstairsif I could borrow their phone I wanted toit wasnt a Smartphone so I couldnt look up the hospitals phone number but I textI called my wife and I asked Can you call Methodist Hospital see if theyre open and just text me back at this number Y if theyre open because the battery was almost dead on the phoneQ:Oh my goshA:In addition to everything else So a couple minutes later she texted back Y so…Q:So they were openA:They were open They were fine Again we didn't know how bad this was It wasnt nearly as bad as it looked when youre in the middle of itQ:Oh I bet I bet thats trueA:So we got them loaded up in the truck The truck took off this way I thought well while Im here maybe I could help this group out They still have their kayak and their air mattresses So we headed to this area the Barker Court Townhomes which every single unit had water in it and thatand it was really deep It was up to our chests And we went to about three homes and in every one the people said Oh were fine Were upstairs I think we gave them a number to call if they wanted to leave but they were pretty confident they wanted to stay And after the second or third one Im like you know we just walked through chest deep water up to someones door The water was here The porch light was on and it was here I don't know if I should be risking my life much longer for folks who just want to stay put I didnt say any of this I was just thinking it Its like if anything happens my wife will be furious at meQ:Yeah exactly with the 1  year old yesA:So at that point I headed back As I got back to the car I noticed the water had risen a little bit further from the level it was at when I started in so at that point I said We should get out of here We went back home moved a few things upstairs put tables up on pots and all the other things youre supposed to do Turned off the breakers and we drove out along I-10 to the west end of Katy and we stayed one night with some friends Its funny their house was fine but they had water at one point almost to their front doorQ:I betA:So in the end they actually cut it a lot closer than we did While I was out there I was monitoring Nextdoor People were posting that the water level was still rising and people in Fleetwood were saying Well this house is definitely flooded and these houses are borderline but they might be okay and these are definitely okay One person posted an elevation map with a hand drawn line of where the water wasQ:Thats whatIve seen some elevation maps Those are really interesting and seemed to be really helpful for peopleA:That was tremendously helpful and I wish I had this It was sent to me via text message and I cant find it now Someone drewI think on Google Mapsa line showing pretty precisely where the water wasQ:Interesting Very interesting yeahA:And I kept in touch with my neighbor across the street on our cul de sac every time I called her Im like oh gosh I know now shes gonna say the water is filling the street or the waters into the house Every time she goes No were fine The powers still on The next day we went back home and everything was fine We were still without power I think after that we checked into a hotel actually really close by right over here I think that one was a FEMA hotel And then later we switched to one provided by our company because all the FEMA hotels had filled up except for things on the other side of the Bayou which for about a week the only way to cross the Bayou was either 20 miles to the east or 15 miles to the west something like thatQ:WowA:It was really tough to get around for awhile Q:Wow So did your renters eventually evacuateA:Oh yes So they evacuated by boat on Tuesday I think it was Sharon and Kenny who got them Im actually not sure but Im pretty sure it was And they stayedthey checked into a hotel next to the one we were staying in stayed there for about a month and then switched to an apartment And theyre eager to move back Theyve still got all their stuff upstairsQ:Oh gosh yeahA:So that was about it as far as the evacuationQ:So in terms of return and cleanup our project kind of stops at evacuation so maybe just a really quick Let me see if there was maybe anything thats directly related to Nextdoor in terms of return could be helpfulA:Yes Lets see I know one thing was after everyone evacuated almost the next day people wanted to go back I forgot my valuables I forgot my medicine I left my pet And the city kept going and the police kept going back and forth on whether we were allowed back At one point no at one point yes at one point if you could walk in but not if you had to swim And they had good reason There were a lot of hazards electrical gas leaks So one awesome thing about Nextdoor was I think it was mainly Sharon but also others were reporting from the front lines No boats are allowed in today or Boats are allowed in First come first serve So if someone was staying at a hotel halfway across Houston or staying with friends that might have saved them a trip so that was very usefulQ:That isA:When we returned on September 8th I think that was when we were finally officially cleared to go back and when the water hadwe believe the water had drained out of our homes I was one of the first to go back to my house and I think people were asking What is it like and I posted on Nextdoor that I got in this way Its passable by truck not by car that kind of thing Your houses stink We had all the windows open And yeah there was some use of Nextdoor to organization initial volunteer cleanup groups although it was mostly specific organizations like church groups that did that Q:Thats what I thoughtA:And then yeah this is well after the fact but everything from sharing buyout offers I was offered this much I was offered that much Hey this is a great drywall contractor Hey these guys showed up for one day and then I never saw them againQ:Oh thats really great and helpful to post thatA:And Sharon probably told you all the debates Kenny got into about the proper ways to re-install insulationQ:Yeah interestingA:Advice in getting FEMA aid and all those discussions still continueQ:Wow thats great Hmm Now you also said that you had a WhatsApp group at work A:Yes Our team Im a reservoir engineer at Shell and my wife also works at Shell Actually our office is like one minute that way Shell has an official notification system that were supposed to use to report that were safe Like a lot of our IT solutions it doesnt work that well I forgot what went wrong I was trying towe were supposed to call in I called in I got put on hold and no one ever picked up something like that But our team unofficially has our own WhatsApp group a team of about 25-30 people So our general manager would requestthankfully he didn't request that everyone check in like every day Hes just like Hey if anything changes with your status let me know So like when we evacuated to Katy I let them know When our power went out I think I mentioned our power was out One of my colleagues offered to let us stay at his house His house ended up flooding only a little bit but _[00:42:25] I think they managed to clean up a month or two ago but still…Another thing we used it forone remarkable thing about this like I said our house didn't flood until Monday One of my colleagues her house is in Bel Air It flooded Saturday morning It affected different parts of towns at different times and she was posting in WhatsApp What do I do My husband has no idea what to do I don't know what to do Should I turn off the breakers And we all gave her some advice thereQ:Youre all engineersA:Mostly engineers some economistsQ:Okay A:And then that was mainly how we used it and then I guess we found out via that WhatsApp group who was impacted and our general manager said Hey lets organize some cleanup groups And we used WhatsApp to plan that Our general manager posted a lot of pictures of himself volunteering in his neighborhood so that kind of set the tone to everyone that hey dont worry about your work I understand everyones got important stuff to take care of He really led by example in that regard Q:Thats great So if youre comfortable with this so the types of things that youve shared here are incredibly incredibly helpful because one of the things that were trying to do is to assess images text threads to see what it really looks like when evacuations are happening And so to actually see the threads like what youve done there is fabulous I haveand Ill leave this with youthis is the dedicated cell phone that I told you that if its easier just to do screenshots but if you have any images or any other things that its not convenient to send screenshots you can email themA:I think I havelets see I know I havewell let me check I think I have all of this is an email and if so itd definitely be better quality than taking a picture I could just forward thatQ:That would be perfectA:If you wanted more information regarding Nextdoorhas Sharon provided you with a lot of that Q:She hasA:To be honest I don't think I could share much in addition or separate to what she would have access to She was right in the middle of all of itQ:Yeah and shes put me in touch with the Nextdoor folks too so I can kind of get an organizational perspective But what were mostly interested in is how real people dealt with this when they were going through it what that looked like in terms of text threads images and how they used maps anything that was shared back and forth all of that would be really helpful The other thing that Im curious about that I would love your opinion on isso the research literature that we draw upon with mobile phones in particular talks about some features of mobile phones that are useful in general in life No ones ever applied that to an emergency context and so one of the contributions we want to make is to do that So Im kind of curious you kind of fall into both of these situations where you were both rescued and you were rescuing others So was it important for you to be able to locate other people to know physically where they were located Was that important or was it not as importantA:Im trying to think of this context like in the case of my tenants I knew where the house was In the case of this other coupe that needed help the woman sent me an address that doesnt exist actually I had to figure it out 613 Lee Shore It was 603 Lee Shore There was no 613 but I kind of just showed up and figured it outQ:Yeah rightA:But yeah that was a big challenge Sharon might have told you the water was so high that most house numbers were underwater so just figuring outI mean you almost have to house by house I think she posted Put out a towel or something we know you need helpQ:What about reaching people was it important to be able to reach people the fact that they had a cell phone or something like thatA:Oh yes That was important and that was a bigI guess that was reallyiflets say if most people or if everyone who needed help had been able to get through to 9-1-1 maybe there wouldnt have been as much Nextdoor organization It might have been people checking on their immediate neighbors and helping people out but most people might have just called 9-1-1 and if they said We can get to you Weve got first responders on the scene Just give us your address Well get there then yeah we might have not… All of this might have not happenedQ:Yeah What about multimedia capability So the fact that people were able to post images that you could see things was that helpfulA:Probably less so than the others I guess the single powerful image or helpful image I remember was when someone shared a map kind of like this that showed how high the water had gotten At that point I was at my friends in Katy and I was just thank goodness at least one our houses is okay and our neighborhoods mostly okay So that was helpful Q:What about portability Think back to maybe your tenants did it seem important that they could take their mobile devices with them and still be able to be reachedA:Oh yes absolutely And if I had had a waterproof or water-resistant phone like my wifes I probably would have kept it with me and maybe would have gotten some better footageQ:Well a lot of people lost their phones Im noticing that rescued other people in particular What about visibility It seems to me like the fact that you can still see that speaks to visibility and persistence as being important but Im curious do you think that was important for the people who you rescuedA:Visibility as far asQ:As social media I would say in generalA:Yeah in the sense that they had to get their message out For the persistence thats actually one of my biggest regrets is I have my phone set and I just did this because I used to have an iPhone 5 with only 16 gigs of memory I had my phone set to only save 30 days of text messages and when my wife got an iPhone 7 and I got her old iPhone 6 with 64 gigs of memory I should have set it to save like a year or more but I kept it at 30 days So I lost all of my text messages from the event and I was thinking after the fact man it would have been so interesting to keep those and someday show them to my son and just have that ability to tell the story but thankfully as far as I know if its on Nextdoor its forever Most of the interesting stuff is on Nextdoor so in the sense ofwell even just preparing for this interview the fact that I could go back and find everything was very helpful I wouldnt have thought to set my phone beforehand to save everythingQ:What about editability Were you all editing maps or updating thingsA:Well the closest thing we have to that is one of our neighborsIm pretty sure Sharon would have mentioned thishe keeps a map of Fleetwood where he tracks based on people emailing him peoples status Are they rebuilding are they occupying their house are they sellingQ:Oh interestingA:Has she mentioned thisQ:I don't know that she didA:Well I can show you an exampleQ:YeahA:I don't know if it fits in with that but hes the one doing the editingQ:Thats so coolA:And all we do is we email him if anything changes and he made this mapQ:Yes So she showed me a map like that but I havent seen them with so many different colorsA:Yeah so this line he drew is approximately everything on this side was flooded at least a little and everything on this side was dryQ:Could we grab a screenshot I would love that or have you just text that to the project phone Thats really helpfulA:If its all right I should ask him if its okay if I shareQ:Oh certainly go right ahead thats fine since thats his I forgot that wasnt necessarily just up thereA:I mean its prettyit doesnt have any names so its probably okay but Ill ask himQ:Please that would be fine Yeah that would be really good Thats so interesting So he tracks all thisA:Im gonna see him in two days so Ill just ask him thenQ:Sounds good And then so finally this notion of association Yall were such a tightlyI mean yall know each other in the communitiesA:I would say I know a lot more people in my old neighborhood than my new one actually so Iveeven though Ive moved I kept my old Nextdoor account partly because there was a lot more discussion here for some reason I don't know why This forum is pretty quiet Ive got a new account there but…Q:Different neighborhoods you know they do things in different ways And so the last thing that I like to do is let me just double check If youd be comfortable Id love to just get general demographicsA:SureQ:And then Ill ask you just kind of one final broad question Ill let you just fill that outA:Okay Q:Wonderful So this is very helpful The last question I always ask people is is there anything that I havent asked about that maybe youre sitting there thinking ooh I think this might be really interesting or differentA:No I think weve covered everything pretty comprehensively Im trying to remember I know there have beenlike I said the Nextdoor in our neighborhood is pretty lively There have even been cases where people have reached out to Nextdoor support with complaints or criticisms about certain features but now that I think about it none of that was relevant to the hurricane I was trying to remember if any of that followed from the experience in the hurricane and now that I think about it no it didn't Its funny before you face a tragedy people complained aboutin retrospectlittle things like when Nextdoor started showing advertisements Oh everyones furious and people were sending angry emails to Nextdoor and all that Well actually just as an aside someone joked that Nextdoor really ought to be a bit more sensitive in tailoring their ads to their communities if they know anything about whats happened And there was some ad about what was it it was something about cook at home meals or something and someone was like Do they provide their own kitchen ours is a bit of a mess at the momentQ:Oh gosh I bet thats true Yeah thats hard So this was so wonderful that you prepared this Are these copies for meA:Youre welcome to keep them or I can email them to youQ:You know if I could do both it would be greatA:SureQ:Then thatll really help me reconstruct your story which will be very helpful And like I said any more screenshots any more of those kind of flows of conversation or images would be wonderful And thank you so much Appreciate your time andA:No problem I hope this helpedQ:This helped a lot I have notit is so interesting because one of the things we do when were doing a big research project is were trying to put together the pieces And you usually reach a point in the project where youve heard a lot of the same things over and over again Im not even close to that A:Did you start interviewing folks earlier todayQ:No were at aboutIm close to 30 interviewsA:Oh wowQ:Primarily in Katy and here And Ive really kind of concentrated in those two areas but then I have some responders whovolunteer responders from all over the place who have come in But once I realized that every area in Houston is different I realized that if I was gonna really understand a story I had to limit it to some extent to the geographyA:Yeah everyone was impacted differently and the emotions are very different I guess one kind of undercurrent that were getting in our areain a lot of Houston areas that flooded people accept that well it was a natural disaster Theres a tremendous amount of frustration in this area over the fact that the flooding did not technically occur from the hurricane It occurred after the fact Im sure youve heard that beforeQ:But that makes sense You said emotion what emotion would you associate with thatA:Anger betrayal We counted on these dams to keep us safe and they failed us I think theres a tremendous amount of frustration that all of the governmental agencies involvedthe city the Harris County Flood Control District the Corps of Engineersare pointing fingers at one another and saying We did our part Its not our fault because again we never received even a voluntary evacuation notice Not so much as a police officer driving down the street with a megaphone saying Everybody get out And I guess yeah in retrospect thats something a lot of us are still frustrated by you know even if it was a foregone conclusion that we had to sacrifice our homes could they have given us a little notice We could have saved our cars and valuables and not put the lives of the elderly folks at risk Im trying to put all that behind me and behind us get our house put back together and hopefully see the community bounce backQ:Yeah hopefully so Well I think if any community can yall are in a good position to doEND OF RECORDING [00:57:51]Gary Energy 2
