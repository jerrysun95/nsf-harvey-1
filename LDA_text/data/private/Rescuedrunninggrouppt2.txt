Rescued Running GroupPart 2 yeah becauseOh really Yes They have a diversion channel So heres the bayou and it goes through our little system and then theres a brilliant civil engineering design that happened a long time ago called the diversion channel and it splinters off of the bayou And its wide and its deep and it goes like this and then it meets back up F3:Absolutely because weve run there before So all of this little pocket right here which is part of Saddlebrook Crossing is an island And it is encapsulated by Buffalo Bayou and the diversion Its called the Welford [00:00:40] Diversion Channel Huh And is it elevated in between those two No No Its the bowl youre talking about F:Its the bowl But there were maybe a dozen houses that were built later and they were elevated So theres maybe a dozen houses that didnt flood Not in my particular neighborhood but I think theres maybe three or four in Saddlebrook Crossing and then the rest are dispersed Through that island theres not many that didnt flood Wow So that was interesting So before we go everybody make sure that theyre okay A couple of key things to note on that are every single thing we do on the project is kept confidential Its not like were putting anything out there publically Its all for the research And were really trying to define and understand what a call for help looks like both from people who need to be rescued and people who go and rescue others and the important role that social media played So thats the key thing The other thing thats really helpful for us in our projectin step one were trying to characterize and understand this and were doing interviews because the richness of the storiesa survey just doesnt cut it We really have to understand and get our hands around whats really going on What were going to do isand I'm gonna ask if any of you have images to share Thats actually super helpful for us because we wanna know what real pictures look like of these real rescues And then were gonna be able to take those imageshi there welcomeinto our databasesduck out if people need to And how are you Good good Are you joining us for this F4:I am Thank you so much Come on in Oh thank you Thats wonderful Let me give youthis is information on the study You actually don't need to sign it You are welcome to keep it And then I also brought cards for everybody as well F:I wanna see the results of the study after the fact because its super interesting Well I have a feeling that whats gonna happen is were gonna haveprobably right now weve identified about ten different research papers that were gonna pull out of the data F:Sweet!So itll be happening for the next several years Usually these big large-scale projects after we collect the interview data and the images were actually gonna be able to go in with humans and code what the images look like So we already know kinda the real characteristic of what somebody who needs to be rescued looks like They tended to post pictures that had a vehicle partially submerged That was usually if people took a picture outside their door or window Thats the typical picture we get Or water coming up And so we have a lot of images that are very helpful for us to see of: What does it look like before And then what does it look like when people realize Ive gotta get out of here And so thats kinda the nature of that What were gonna do afterwe use our graduate students primarily to code these imagesis I have a colleague whos a computer scientist and does a lot of work with machine learning And so were actually gonna train our machine to then look for these same kinda characteristics in these images And if they can identify the same thing then we can go out and see if we cant apply this idea to other types of emergencies to identify kind of needles in a haystackso when someone needs help Thats the ultimate kind of big-picture goal of what were going for F4:Its like youll almost know before they themselves know Youll see that and go: Theyre in a situation It would be great if we could really get to that point because ultimately were doing this to save lives Hi there How are you Are you Cal by chance M1:I am I thought I might recognize that from the picture Thank you so much We so appreciate it F:Good morning How are you So let me give you one of these Go ahead and look through this Make sure that youre comfortable being a part of this group And just to let you know since you walked in were recording it too F:Help yourselves to coffee water snacks as well Theres plenty ofGosh Yall do this every Saturday morning [laughter] Is this for reward after people run early in the morning Is that what it is F:Oftentimes yes And in the afternoon its beer right F:Well yes Ive definitely seen the beer pictures F:And weve got a popcorn machine back there too F:And we have a beer fairy A beer fairy I saw that F:We kinda wish she was here F:Shes in Michigan right now Julie is who I started with interviewing So I got to learn a whole lot A couple other things I'm gonna tell your group Yall are interesting to me becauseand I told a couple people earliermy son is a competitive indoor rock climber at the national level and so I understandand I think your daughters right are starting to climb some M:Yeah So if I can ever help let me know cause I know pretty much the gyms all over literally Not internationally yet Well hope for that in the future So I understand a lot about an individual sport thats actually people function as a group and as a team and as a support environment for each other And whenever I started lookingactually it happened the middle of Julies interview I went: This is the exactly the same thing Yall have some skills that arent necessarily rescuing people Its not what you do every day But because you work as a team and you work in this supportive environment there might be some really interesting things that we could learn about how people come together to help others because they have these pre-established relationships So thats something I would love to know more about Hi how are you F:Good morning Good good Come in Oh my goodness Are yall here to join us to talk about this Thank you so much Come on in [unrelated background chitchat] I did too Well get kinda started in general and well decide how itll work best I'm pretty flexible So the other thing Ill let the group know that is probably relevant to yall is that when I was in the third gradeare you in the sixth F:Fifth When I was in the third grademy parents were both public school teachers; we lived paycheck to paycheck They had just leveraged everything to build a brand-new home on family land (not on a floodplain) and we got a call that they were gonna let water out from the Clear Fork of the Brazos River and it was gonna flood us And so I still remember all the conversations in our family and at the church about: No way! Its never been here before Its not gonna happen So we didnt evacuate And then as the water came over the road people show up and theyre like Weve gotta get the kids out Weve gotta get the piano out a couple of things And there wereso there was five feet of water in our house for two and a half weeks So literally we lost everything and had to gut pretty much everything except the cabinets that were above that level So I grew up in a house that had been rebuilt after that and so my parents were paying on two mortgages because of course we didnt have flood insurance And at that time the thing that I remember the most about the experience is that the Red Cross came in and had furniture set up in the church The woman took me when I had walked into my bedroomwe had oil tankers that spilled and so everything coated in oil everything The irony of that is that if everything had burned everybody wouldve been covered right Youve all probably been through that But there was oil coveredand so when I walked into my bedroom on the carpet as an eight-year-old I saw the frogs dead on my floor from the oil And this wonderful woman grabbed me and said Honey what color furniture have you always wanted And of course everything was yucky and I was like White [laughter] So the furniture I grew up on was a beautiful white bedroom set with flowers donated by the Red Cross Pretty much all of our furniture that we grew up in was donated And I knew from a very young age that I would have to put myself through college Even though my parents were college educated paying on two mortgages is gonna take a long time Theyve now managed to break even but thats quite a few years later So when I saw this call out there for the National Science Foundation grant I literally just was like Ive got to do this So they had a really quick turnaround on the project and I was like No I think something is really really different about how people were rescued about how communities came together So thats my motivation behind why I wanted to get involved I told people when we were putting the proposal together you usually have about a two-percent chance of getting these grants because the competition is so stiff And we got it And I was like Well family Are yall okay with me giving up Thanksgiving Christmas all my holidays Because youve gotta catch the data quickly or people forget and they get rid of their images So thats kinda whats driving our study So since were all here I had to have people break off Itll probably be great to kinda let you share your stories So give me an idea who all was involved in the rescue effort if yall will kinda give a show of hands Okay And then who wasF:We were rescued We werent rescuers Okay Yall were rescued And who was just rescued Okay And then who was both rescued and then rescued others Anybody Yall are kind of a separate group F:But there are those people M:Yeah Weve got a number of people who did that F:My husband Yes And Ive interviewed a fair number of people that have been in both situations So I think that what might work bestif yall dont mind we might kinda separate into two groups people who were rescued and then people rescued others because the questions I asked are a little bit different Do I have anybody who needs to take off quickly so that we should do that group first F:I just have to leave at 11 Okay Maybe we can do the people who were rescued first and have that conversationgive me about 20 minutesand then have the other group come back over if yall would be okay with that M:Yeah Okay Thank you so much So Ill have yall come in and Ill grab that out so that I'm kind of asking the right questions All right so do me a favor One of the things I do is I give everybody a pseudonym so thateven though we keep all the data internally I dont care who peoples real names are so I give them a fake name So what would you like your fake name to be Have you ever thought about that Just a standard name is fine I always say I wanted desperately to name my daughter Brooke and my last name is now Stevens and I didnt want her to have the initials BS [laughter] So I always give the name Brooke because that was what I wanted and it didnt happen F:Emily All right wonderful Well call you Emily today How about you sir M:Casper Thats what I wanted to callCasper Very cool All right How about you F:How about Brooklyn Brooklyn Okay All right So youve already shared a little bit about kind of how you were rescued But do me a favor and each of you just kind of quickly tell me the story of when you realized you needed to be rescued and kinda what led up to that F:I guess it was Saturday that I realized we were in trouble I'm a meteorologist so I knew that the rain was gonna be extensive but wed had a flood [00:14:08] day flood Yes yes F:And at that point we had 17 inches at our home but it was within a 30-hour period Oh wow F:That water got about six feet from the house Our home was covered under flood insurance because of our previous experiences I knew that Tuesday we were gonna have a very large amount I knew 40 inches sounded about a rough estimate But I also knew it was gonna be spread out in a five- to six-day period And I had a broken leg and I had just had surgery so I couldnt evacuate My husband had to be at work at the plant in case of shutdowns I couldnt drive So me and the kids and my husband stayed with us and also our pets By Saturday our exit points were already flooded because of the Bayou Island that we live in Yes right F:And so Saturdaywe would have extensive rain and then the street would drain but our street was already covered So by Sunday we would have extensive rain and then we would have dry periods But on Sunday the water didnt go down So at that point I realized: Were going to flood It wasnt a shock to me at that point But about 9:00 at night the water came rushing into the house very quickly It did Okay F:So about 9:00 that night we could look out our window and see underwater And so at that point I realized Okay we cant stay We have to get out So about 9:00 Sunday night is when I realized we needed to get out Did you take pictures of what that looked like Did you post anything on social media at that point F:At that point I hadthings were posted on social media but I didnt have the wherewithal to snap the interior pictures We have a lot of pictures outside of the house We were rescued Sunday night but my husband stayed with the animals through Monday night So we were rescued separately And he had pictures of Monday Interesting Okay Ill give you my card in a minute What I have isone of the things thats very helpful for us to try to figure out what this actually looks like when people is we have a dedicated project phone [00:16:41] Images that come in just come in for our project and then the other thing is we have an email address that people are sending us images because one of the things that is most helpful to us in our project is to see what that looked like and what real experiences look like Thats the real key difference F:Cal is actually the one that came and rescued our family He did Okay F:Him and another friend Rob The live streamed Yes they did F:So those photos that you see from Cals social media those are me and my children Okay I didnt make that connection but Ive seen some of his images How did they know you needed to be rescued F:Facebook I had called my dad who was in San Antonio and he called his friends who had airboats I'm sure you saw the airboats the next day But they couldnt get here until Monday morning I put that out on social media thinking Monday would be the day we got out But Cal and Rob came and got us overnight Wow amazing How about you M:We live on Kenwood Greens so really close  [00:18:09] We were kind of looking on We saw the water was coming My son was actually ill on Friday so I had to pick him up from daycare So that was actually a bit of a godsend We were thinking the worst case would be a power cut so we were stocking up on food on water on batteries We werent thinking floods And then it was probably through the website nextdoorcom Thats where the sheriff was putting the postings of: There will be a flood and these are the areas My wife was still like This isnt happening And I was like Well lets just start moving stuff upstairs We didnt flood until Tuesday So again we didnt have flood insurance so we just tried to save what we could The water came up really slowly The same thing It was just bands of rain bands of rain It would go back down and then it just always felt like it was just gonna happen It was almost just: Flood so we can get it over withOne of the problems we had was thewe were always under kind of a voluntary evacuation Even under voluntary we couldnt get out because though our street was okay (it was kind of knee deep)  the entrances to the streets were both flooded kind of chest high and we had two young kids and two dogs So we werent going anywhere So the only other option we had would be to walk acrosstheres a golf course Willow Fork which you could escape through Again it was underwater and you just had to know where to go So we did the same thing We knew we were gonna flood and we flooded on Tuesday morning On Monday nightI think it was about three in the morningwe did phone the kind of official phone number and they were like Well get to you at some point So same thing a Facebook messageCal was one of our other friends There was like a walky-talky app thing that we were using which we didnt have a clue how to use but my friend did So between Cal and our other friend and both of the calls in to send boats thats where we were We got out like half-ten on Tuesday morning We escaped through one of the windows We had sandbagged all the doors We tried everything we could to keep the water out but it came in anyway through the seep holes [00:20:21] We took on literally one seep hole deep of water which was enough to flood So we didnt get as much but it still did Wow Okay So you mentioned Nextdoor You mentioned posting on Facebook One thing thatas were talking to people if you actually still have on your phones what you posted on Facebook what a lot of people are doing is theyre just screenshotting that and sending me a screenshot of what you posted that captured peoples attention So that would be really helpful M:Yeah It was mainly my wife that was posting Its so interesting Ive heard that a lot that it was a familyit was a multiple-person kind of effort to get these posted Thats so interesting I wouldve never imagined but I hear that a lot How about you Brooklyn F:Youre in Saddlebrook Crossing So are we Oh okay F:Weve lived in our house for seven years and although we never really thought it would floodmy husbands a  [00:21:26] scientistwe have insurance thank God But coming from the north the worst thing weve ever dealt with and are familiar with are blizzards You stay inside and youre fine Never imagined that we would flood Just like he said we stocked up on food because we thought the worst case scenario would be wed run out of pop So our garage refrigerator was packed with weeks worth of food and our regular refrigerator was packed with weeks worth of food and cases of water Finally I'm like Mike were gonna flood Weve gotta start moving this stuff upstairs First thing is the sentimental furniture that used to belong to my mother Bring that upstairs Ironically our son that goes to Texas A&M Galveston was evacuated to our house so we had muscle to help my husband move furniture up to the second floor which was a godsend But in hindsight it wasnt good because then his car ended up getting totaled We lost three cars And had he stayed in Galveston he wouldve been fine They ended up only getting a couple inches But anyway…So we started taking on water Monday night and we didnt evacuate until Tuesday Everything was by cell phone all communication I was constantly with neighbors Whos still in the neighborhood How are you getting out We got out Where are you Were here Were at the school right now Wheres everybody evacuating to How does this work So anyway we ended upa neighbor of ours had a friend that had a boat that came at like 10:00 in the morning on Tuesday We had six people two dogs and a snake that my college student brought home with him So we had to take two boats cause our neighbors were on the first boat and there was only enough room for like my son on the first boat and then the rest of us went on the second boat I took four Facebook Live videos We had four different legs The first leg was a boat It took us to the Bayou Bridge at Beck [00:23:33] Then we had to walk across the bridge to another boat that they pulled for some reason I don't know if their motor broke down But these poor guys from Laredo are walking in the water pulling our boat which I was thankful for because I had just had surgery so I still had an open incision I wasntmy incision was here and the water was like two inches away from that So that was scary So we walked across the bridge to the second boat that we got pulled to and then we got into a Jeep that drove us to a Hummer that took us to Alexander which is only 18 miles away from our home It seemed to take forever having four different legs So ever leg was a Facebook Live video and my friends back in Buffalo New York were like Oh my God! Theyre like I'm speechless This is horrible Because I was filming like submerged cars that were floating by I bet F:Yeah And they had on their life jackets and they were holding onto the dogs We finally made it to the school and there were tons of people First of all we saw a bunch of trailers which people from all over the country brought their boats down It was amazing overwhelming all these people They dont get reimbursed for their gas Their vehicles and boats are getting trashed and its all out of the goodness of their own heart It was amazing F:Can I just interject Yes F:We the people the government got here before the elected government got here Oh the volunteers did yeah F:Absolutely F:Yes F:By days F:I'm not saying anything negative against our government at all because it takes a long time But that is where we the people and the government have towe have a responsibility to each other F:Oh and I plan on paying it forward I don't know how but everybody can do something which is what I was getting at When I got to the school there were two lines One line was for people who were picking up friends Another line was people that were picking up total strangers and taking 'em wherever they needed to go Oh thats so cool F:I'm like I can do that Thats something I can do in the future when theres a tragedy somewhere Everybody can help out in some way Thats so true F:So anyway friends of my husbands who I barely even knew picked us up He thought we were bringing six dogs for some reason Actually we had three because Duncan was with us We had three dogs I'm like You still came to pick us up and you thought we had six dogs They said Come on! So we all got in He took us back to his house I barely knew these people And we ended up staying there seven weeks and they were so wonderful They were so wonderful Was the snake in a cage F:Yeah Where did he end up taking that when he went back and got the snake I don't know He went back a couple days later He fed the snake because apparently this is how these things work They can go days without eating So my husband went back a couple days later and said he had to rescue a pet [laughter] He comes out to the Coast Guard with this snake I don't remember where he ended up taking that thing I don't care But anyway he did rescue a snake  And yeah we stayed with these people Seven weeks F:They opened up their house They gave us the guest room They turned the game room into a bedroom for the twins And my one son shared a bedroom with a boy he never met before This little boy opened up his bedroom for seven weeks and shared it with a total stranger They dogs all played They have two dogs and the dogs just had a big dog party for seven weeks It was great Wow thats amazing If you still have the Facebook Live videosF:I have everything yeah That would be super helpful especiallyIve also heard this multiple legs to the rescue Thats something thats never been documented before and so as I'm seeing that emerge if we can actually show people that this is not a one person makes a call One person goes to rescue But its a community effort and its this sequential kind of process It would be really helpful Okay cool So I am kind of curious One of the things that were trying to do is were trying to understand the features of mobile devices in particular that are helpful during a rescue So what I have for each of youand Ill just wrote your names on each of these and then Ill walk you through together as a group These are features of these devices and Ill explain If you could do me a favor and let me know if you thinkdo we have any pens Sorry about that I shouldve brought more in I had 'em in the car and didnt do it Okay thanks So the first thing that I'm curious about is locatability Was it important that people should locate you during the rescue F:Well yes but it was fairly simple It was our home address Okay And could people see the home address or did they know where you already lived so that didnt matter F:Probably both but I did place my home address out And it was the first time that I had ever opened my Facebook to the public because it was always very very private And I opened it up for about three weeks and I had my address on there Okay yeah That makes sense How about you M:Yeah Ours all our street numbers were underwater so the way that we did it we hadinstead of the white sheetwell we did a white sheet outside But we also had a flat from the Olympics when London hosted As an athlete knowing he would recognize it and made it different thats the image we put out: This is our house with that flag Oh thats cool You posted a picture of that also in addition to putting the flag out M:Yeah So your locatability was physical It wasnt necessarilythey werent like tracking you on your mobile phone or anything like that M:No I don't think so no Okay How about you Brooklyn F:It was just our neighbor who was somebody with a boat I don't know if this would help you or anything but do you know that Google Maps is still showing the flooded Do you know that They havent updated that Could you just screenshot that F:Sure Everything is still brown and flooded from our neighborhood Interesting Because Ive found some  [00:29:50] buthuh its still up there Huh Thats interesting So thats an aerial image of this area M:Yeah And they left it[crosstalk] F:You can still see my car in the driveway that got totaled Yeah theres my Suburban You cant even see our poor We put in a brand-new pool like a year and a half ago All you can see is the hot tub Thats just the hot tub The pools totally underwater And theres my Suburban that got totaled And two cars in the garage got totaled Could you screenshot that F:Sure Theres our trampoline Yall are so sophisticated Yall know how to screenshot [laughter] Ive never needed that before and my grad student showed me how to screenshot because I didnt know how to do it All right so the next one on there is reachability Was it important for people to be able to reach you using mobile devices F:Oh definitely And do you think it was important for the people who were rescuing you F:Yes Okay The next one is available Was it important for you to be available to be reached F:Yes Okay And the next one is multimedia capability Was it important for you to be able to post images and do Facebook Live Do you think that helped for you and people rescuing you F:Oh wow Thats crazy Is there a lot of stuff out there still F:I was just looking at it yeah all the brown You can see thatThe aerial stuffIll never be able to look at an aerial picture the same way again Portabilitydid you take your mobile devices with you F:Oh yes definitely Were they important for you Visibility Do you think it was important for people to be able to see what you put out there in general F:Important as far as what An important part of your rescue F:No I wouldnt think so Okay F:They just needed my house And once they found us at the houseThats great Thats helpful to know The next one is persistence Is it important that its still there that you can still go find these images that you can still find things to share with people M:Yeah And then this next one is editability And what most people have told me this seems relevant especially with maps and updating whos been out and who hasnt Was that something that was important to you personally F:Yes Did you edit images Did you edit maps anything like that during the rescue or not F:No And then the last one is association What that means is the fact that you were affiliated with a group like the running group like your community groups Was that helpful in your rescue F:I would just have to say the Cinco Ranch Ladies Club went above and beyond helping all the members There were women out there gutting homes for fellow members They did so much This one woman spearheaded everything: forwarding resources of companies that can help us and free instant pot and free cookware from another company They were amazing M: [00:33:06] that was the big difference And its weird because myself and my wifemy wifes Scottish We actually talked about this Would we have had the same reaction in Britain if this had happened And the answer we came to was no So in Texas or Katyville is very different Thats so interesting And Ive definitely heard that pretty consistently F:Can you explain availabilityI can Was it important for you to be available for someone to reach you And did mobile devices play an important role in that for you F:Through social media or just the device You know what It could be through social media A lot of times people interchange those And then some people tell me that texting mattered but social media didnt or maybe it was a combination M:For us the texting was more within our direct neighbors and peopleyoud walk out and neighbors you hadnt ever spoken to before suddenly you had this instant connection whereas social media was the broader group It was done directlyF:And I find that with the texting I'm in very close contact with the nine people on my street We have our own texting chain But through social media its kind of moved on becauseM:Us too We did the same thing as a group (set up the day before it flooded) of people living on our street Thats great So yall set this up the day before it flooded So you did you have this network in place for immediate neighbors M:Yes F:We wanted to know who got out There was this one thingwere not  [00:34:39] like You need to get out This isnt safe M:Deniers F:Yes They finally left Tuesday after we left F:We still share ours with contractor information and where to buy certain fixtures and how to navigate the government assistance So we still use ours multiple times a day And its your immediate group thats using it Its not Canyons and Cinco Ranch Homeowners Association F:Its not the neighborhood Its just the street Wow So yall created your own networks of people close to you Makes senseF:So in a way that would a micro type of social media that weve created on our own Thats well said Thats exactly what it is but youre using it through texting which isand its a group right Youve created a group F:Yeah Wow What do you call your group F:We call itwell I think its the Fairwit Court [00:35:37] Its just our street name I don't think we had a special name F:Ours is Harvey Flood Girls Thats great Thats interesting So the last kinda big-picture question before we invite other people in is: If you don't mind on the second page I'm trying to capture basic demographics of people who are in the study So if you would fill that out I thought about bringing clipboards but those clipboards are really super helpful I even have a couple Yeah F:Just number nine Yeah Just a little bit down there Theres just four questions F:So whats interesting is that I don't live here I live 30 miles west Of course I didnt experience any flooding but was kinda stuck couldnt go anywhere So the only place I got all my information about what all my friends were going through was from Facebook because the news was not there the first few days You werent hearing like the big picture F:Houston F:Exactly But what was going on here I was well informed because of my friends Yes I'm definitely hearing that from the outside that was a much more real account than the news or anything that was official F:Until the news reporters got into boats and started going out there But that was like two or three days after the fact M:It wasnt 'til Wednesday or Thursday None of us  [00:37:20] The first time we let a crew in was Thursday F:So everything we learned we learned it through Facebook M:I would say not only us; there was a number of others Our page exploded We had a couple of our posts updating on the Barker Reservoir We don't generally see 2000 or 3000 views on an average post and one of ours had a quarter-million A quarter-million posts M:Well reactions/views The reach I guess Facebook calls it I think it was shared almost 1000 times So we saw that popping up through all the community neighborhoods Because like you said there was no local reporting so we were putting out what we were getting from various county OEM and from the fire desk and everything we had But it was the only specific Katy area data especially on the reservoir 90% of the Barker Reservoir is in our district Right M:So we were getting stuff directly from the Army Corps on somewhat flood control We got better data from the Corps But when we put out like our inundation maps nobody in Harris County had ever seen them They never got released Ive heard that M:We were the first ones to release it And it was only because were like The news is reporting on Houston The news isnt reporting on the west side So we began trying to do that Thats interesting So what I might do is ask yall to kind of step back and let me ask the rescuers to come forward Youre welcome to stay and participate in that conversation or you could sit back there and send me some images and you can take off If you would do me a favor though and send me those images while theyre still fresh in your mind because I literally do have grad students that before the first can sit there and help me out and get stuff done Thank you so much F:Thank you Ill give this to somebody in a minute as well Thank you I appreciate it so much All right so we will kind of switch gears for a minute Since you were talking firstall right let me go ahead now Tell me which agency when you said we M:Yeah ESV48 [00:39:44] which stands for Emergency Services  [00:39:48] What most people don't know is in the Katy area theres actually ten different fire departments that serve the Katy area In fact Katy Fire which people would assume service Katy only serves the Katy proper They had some serious flooding as well They serve about 10000 of the 300000 so actually are the smallest department in the Katy area We serve basically where they stop 84 Bend [00:40:10] all the way over to Fry Road And then we go from Clay Road in the north all the way down to the Barker Reservoir along the Harris/Foreman line [00:40:19] So 90% of the Barker issue was in our district and was in our territory But I will say that almost every department had their own rescues Katy we actually ended up having to rescue them from their station on day one So then they mobilized out of Katy Mills Mall for most of the time which actually worked out because the National Guard and others staged over there So they had extra resources But they had almost all of Old Katy flooded And then on the north side  [00:40:46] had Cypress and all that and they cover a portion of Katy as well so they had some challenges Then Community serves the Fort Bend side of Canyon Gate and all that I was just sharing in the backCommunity has always been a little reluctant to work with neighboring departments Their chief that was that way is retiringactually tomorrow is his last dayso Ive already talked to the new chief Theyre actually establishing for the first time a PIO Its a public information officer which is what I am So they will be the second departmentwell technically the third department in the area to have a designated PIO So I'm thinking ____ [00:41:29] could chat I would love to get in you in touch with them I would love to talk with them M:And then Constable Wayne Thompson he did the yeomans work during this and hes a good friend of mine I think he would be very interested in this because hes extremely social media savvy And I had heard that in this area that the officials actually did great with social media Lots of people have said some positive things about the fact that they were at least there whereas in Houston I think the police chief did some stuff but its so tricky M:Its so high level and strategic and there really was not a lot of tactical We ended up establishing some separate command posts The closest one to here is at Exley Elementary We set up a command post there We set up a command post on the east side of our territory over by KingslandMm-hm okay M:And then we did our best to get in there with the assets we had We had two boats that we had just received from a grant for the firehouse which was perfect timing They came in literally weeks before the Harvey storm Wow What kind of boats M:Rubber rescue boats So theyre low draught Theyre portable so we canliterally one of 'em is a blow-up one It inflates with an air pack You take an air pack off plug it in it blows up and you can put six guys in it Thats cool M:So we were out there But one of the things we were talking about in the back is: One of the major differences on our side in Harris County was we were specifically working with civilian assets and they were integral to our process Yes you were M:On the Fort  [00:43:14] side the sheriffs office especially in certain areas was not as accommodating And so we had actually during the third and fourth and fifth days when there was an issue of the Barker being overfilled we had situations where we actually were escorting people back into their properties if they could prove their identity or address on National Guard trucks Whereas on the Fort  [00:43:46] side the sheriffs had the judge declare a mandatory evacuation and so they were precluding anyone from going back in So you had people standing there going My house is right there Why cant I go My pets are in there It was kinda nuts But it was just a different approach Harris County never created a mandatory They allowed each district to kind of do their own thing I think Houston did for the east side of the BarkerYeah M:Memorial area They did M:But that was later Then again that was flooding related after the fact It wasnt a protection of keeping people out and that was part of the issue But my thought with this was: If I can find a little bit more of the specifics of what youre looking for we had a huge following on our Facebook because we were the only ones putting stuff out We also have Nextdoor which allows us to hit people specifically Weve got about 20000 of our 40000 homes that are on Nextdoor So its pretty high Weve been driving that for the past two years that weve been on Nextdoor I think itd be very simple if we had a specific request of what exactly that weIve gotta get the chiefs approval but I think we could put a request out for people to participate and that might get you a lot of folks there Yes M:I bet you Constable Thompson would probably be interested on the Fort [00:45:09] side as well Thats great M:Itd be worth chatting I will say from the rescue side I think we ended up doing 1500 but one of our learning points we found was we had so many people being pulled out (we were talking in the back) that we know that that is a very low number Yes it is Right M:One of our learnings was in these mobilewe had a scribe When you set up an incident command there are certain things that you set up and one of them is generally a scribe that follows the chief around And so in our EOC our emergency operations center we had a scribe and shewe joke She fortunately had someone drop a Halligan tool on her handfortunately her left hand But she was on light duty when this happened So even though she wished she could be on the truck she got stuck in the EOC and she wrote with her good hand the entire time for like eight days straight So she was amazing But we didnt have scribes in the command vehicles of our battalion chiefs who were at the mobile places So we had boats coming up and we had sent them to go get five people The problem was on the way in they got 20 others So when they came back out they said Hey we got 'em Great And so theyd check off that call Well that got recorded as five rescues because those were the five we sent them in on It didnt record the other 20 So at the end of some of these days wed talk with the captains and say Hey it looks like you got about 50 60 folks for us And they would be like No no no My boat had at least 400 just by myself and that doesnt include the other ten So there were probably tens of thousands of rescues that never got properly recorded unfortunately just because we had never dealt with something on this scale And how often do you send someone in for five people and have them come out with 20 Thats justthat wasnt something we foresaw No no M:But yeah I think we officially had 1500 or so And Community Fire who will now have this new PIO I'm gonna meet with him next week they had over 3000 rescues So they not only had stuff all around there but they had a whole bunch south of West Park Wow yes M:Some Brazos area stuff too Yeah Ive been in the Fleetwood neighborhood over there and I'm actually talking to Nextdoor as well because they set up a map system where they could literallythey track One of their HOA really militant women sat literally and tracked who was out of their homes and who still needed to be rescued Its the only documentation that Ive seen of someone who literally tracked this Because youre right We didnt know But that was a neighborhood of 245 homes M:Its a lot easier to doIts a lot easier to do than when youre dealing with huge communities So actually one of the things that I'm hoping we will be able to say is something about: How do you plan again for this in the future And then how do you coordinate with your volunteers Because thats something weve also never seen before M:And from an agency level we don't have access to the inner communications of Nextdoor We can send messages We can received direct messages and replies but we cant see the conversation So when somebodywe had this: Hey this persons been saying that theyre stuck and they need rescue Why arent you guys responding We don't see that Screen capture it and direct message me and then were happy to do it But we cant see the dialogue So some people were posting and then it was getting to us third and fourth hand because we don't have access to that kinda stuff So it might be interesting if Nextdoor has some sort of emergency button Theyre talking about doing that with police as far as when somebody posts about a suspicious person They can hit a button and it will send a copy directly to the sheriffs Itd be great if they had either another button or its an emergency and then it would go to the local fire department The challenge is theres a lot of fire departments that arent on Nextdoor We were the third in all of Houston to adopt it And now locally many of them have I helped get Katy online and I think Westlake online but theres a lot of 'em who still don't know that they can do that So theres a lot of education I think on how to use social media Fire departments are behind the law enforcement guys by a long shot in utilizing social mediaI didnt realize that I do wanna be sure that we follow up because part of what is so interesting about this is that the research literature sitting out there on PIOs in particular talks about how many of them are not connected through social media even today And I think this might be an amazingM:response at major scenes Right exactly And so this might really be an important example of showing just how critical that is M:We actuallyin our EOC we mobilized We got a volunteer Sharon Graff [00:50:07] who actually was potentially gonna be here but she didnt make it Sharon wasshe had time and she was able to get to it and so she came in and she helped me Starting on Monday she stayed for probably two or three days and we responded to every question we received on Facebook It was thousands of them Between her and Iand this is what youre supposed to do The problem is most departments dont have a dedicated PIO and if they do theyre not social savvy So what we did was for simple questions of Hey do you know how long the flooding is supposed to last we had agreed-upon answers we were gonna give She could answer those There was about half the questions she never even had to bring to me The other half she brought to me and 30% of those I could answer with what I knew And then occasionally we would have a question where wed go to the chiefs and say Hey theyre asking this How do you want us… What can we do here Or maybe its a question about response and that kinda thing It worked perfectly But I could not have done it myself I stayed up I think at one point for 44 hours straight And when I finally went to sleep for two hours I came back and there were 300 more questions [laughter] Talk about overload M:It wouldve improved if all of our neighboring agencies had a similar system because people who werent in our district were the primary ones asking us questions because we were the only ones posting new local data If we could get the other agencies involved I think we could improve the whole response Thats so interesting All right thats really helpful Who do you want to be Who do you want your pseudonym to be M:I can be Simon All right wonderful So let me go through and also capture everybody else whos here as a volunteer rescuer I love your examples Who do you wanna be Do you wanna be Hal M:Cal yeah Well a name other than your actual name M:Does it need to be It doesnt have to be but a lot of times Ill just randomly assign M:Well I'm Simon but if you wanna assign me something else I don't care Okay Ill do something else M:I have no issues with being public I'm already public anyway Okay you are public okay Ill just make a note of that [END OF RECORDING] 1
