Tracy Katy 2 Establish TrustM:purpose and those files wont be re-shared with anyone No We don't Its literally just so we don't have to take frantic notes and we don't miss details Thats it Okay So this is Stacy and were gonna continue And so I guess just walk us through just kind of briefly where you were when your house startedwhen the flooding started happening How did that all take place Okay Lets step back a little bit So you said your project is funded by National Science Foundation Yeah Heres actually all the details and youre welcome to keep that copy if you would like So its funded by the National Science Foundation and essentially what they did iswe are all trying to figure out how we can rescue people when disasters happen Thats what this is all about So thats a private organization or its a government organization So the National Science Foundation funds our research and thats part of the government Howeverit is government But its independent money and they actually don't even see my data They just provide the funds The university that were a part of us UT Austin and so thats where we do our research there But they gave me the money to be able to travel and to bring graduate students with me on these projects You have graduate students already M:Yeah I'm a graduate student We have graduate students And hell be doctor in May Wow Hes working on his dissertation right now Wow great And whats your major M:I'm in organizational communication technology and Carrie is my advisory Oh is that right Oh okay great Yup weve worked together for almost six years Six years Wow thats great I know The worst part about my job is that they leave me So where are you from Are you from China M:Im from China Oh okay  Northern part of China right M:Yeah  [00:02:30] Whats the city M: [00:02:37] Where are you from F3: [00:02:43] All right So how long have you been in the States F3:Ive just come this August This is my first year here Oh okay Whats your major F3:Interpersonal communication Oh wow Thats kind of difficult major M:We are all in the department of communication studies and Professor  [00:03:05] is my advisor for my doctor training Oh okay great great Yeah I came here as a graduate student also I went to UH My major is structural engineering Oh my gosh Are you serious Yeah My daughterseverywhere where shes applied is architectural engineering and shes very interested in structural Is that right That was my bachelor I went to  [00:03:36] University Really And what did you get your masters in or your graduate work in I got masters degree in civil engineering from UH and then I got my master degree in business administration from Rice Thats great And what types of things have you done Ive been an engineer for a long time for 21 years but recently I'm actually financial analystfinancial advisor I am starting my own business You are Well congratulations Working in insurance and retirement and investment Wow So how waswere you in civil primarily civil engineering structural I was in structural engineering yeah yeah in the energy industry In the energy industry Yeah Was that pretty decent for women a pretty decent career or not so much Well obviously its pretty well paid That part I am lucky It is still dominated by white male Thats what I understand And so its okay to be an engineer or to be technical person but its harder to get into management level Oh that makes sense It makes complete sense So I see that its okay when you are young in a corporate [sic] But once you get to middle age you see the glass ceiling You really do You do see the glass ceiling yes Thats why I prefer starting my own business Thats great Oh thats really exciting Well its crazy So where did you come from from China Which part From close to Shanghai Hangzhou Yeah I know Hangzhou Where the G20 was held last year Yeah very cool M:And Alibaba Alibabathats right! Headquarters of Alibaba M:They call Hangzhou the most modernist city in China right now because of Alibaba Theyve got all of those investments and experiments going on in the city Oh wow interesting M:Very high-tech connected everywhere Well I havent been to China I really want to go Ive been to Japan Ive been to Korea But I havent been to China yet But I'm a native Texan and I grew up about six hours north of here When I was in the third grade we had a fluke water release that was let out of our river that was close to our house and we had five feet of water in our house for two and a half weeks Thats devastating It was devastating And we like most people around here didnt have insurance My parents hadWas it a one-story house or a two-story house It was a one-story house Oh my goodness Pretty much you lost everything We lost everything And so it wasso my whole life my parents told me from a very young age you will have to put yourself through college because we will not be able to help you And so I started workingyall dont even know this I got a great job when I was in the ninth grade a freshman in high school and I worked pretty much about 20-30 hours a week as a waitress at a country club and it paid extremely well and I actually had two full years of college saved before I went to college Wow! Thats nice So I ended up being very fortunate It all worked out really well for me But when this project hit I literally was sitting in my house and looked at my husband and said Ive gotta write this grant Ive gotta see if theres any way I can do this because its something I have always felt that I wanted to give back What happened to me wasI remember walking back in and we had had oilits an oil-heavy part of Texas and the tankers had spilled over because the water was rushing through for so long so everything was covered in oil So when we walked back in not only did we have the sheetrock damage and everything pretty severe but everything was coated in oils So there were dead frogs on my carpet This fabulous woman from the American Red Cross grabbed me and said Honey come with me And she took me to the church and she said We have bedroom sets here What color furniture have you always wanted And I was like I want white with flowers And she said I have a whole bedroom set for you And so all the furniture that I grew up on was donated by the Red Cross and it still is in my house that my parents have still to this day So this situation hits just extremely close to home for me so I was really compelled toI saw social media helping people and a lot of times we talk about social media being problematic But this seemed very very different People were able to connect with others They got rides They got rescues They got everything So thats at the heart of what our project wants to study is: In the future how are we going to be using all these different social media platforms and personal mobile devices to help rescue people So thats what it is Okay great Well I appreciate that you let me know your story Oh absolutely Well I know that its hard Its also brought back a lot of memories for me as Ive talked to people because I know I was a kid but I can remember a whole lot I just know how when it happens and you don't even think youre in a flood zone area its shocking Well yeah I think its great that you could you use your previous experience to kind of contribute and do something yeah I think that thats a good way of making yourself probably a better situation Yeah I think so too So I'm very interested in learning what it looked like what people went through how we can help people in the future be able to be rescued faster that kind of thing So thats the federal or thats the state government that sponsored Were actually not necessarily working directly with any governments Ultimately I think our findings are gonna help at all levels However the money comes from the US government Its an agency that gives money the National Science Foundation As a matter of fact a lot of engineers get whats called a career grant very early in their career If youre a physical scientist or an engineer almost all of your funding for your structural work is actually done through the National Science Foundation As a social scientist they don't fund us very often Yeah Its not But what I did is I have partnered with a computer science person and were gonna take what I find in terms of what really happened to people and were gonna train the computer to then go out and look at images to tell us whats real and whats not real So were hoping we can identify real calls for help in the future to help So yeah thats kind of the connection there Interesting Yeah Okay all right Great So Id love to learn some more about what happened to yall in terms of whatin this areaI know this area fairly well now because Ive interviewed a number of people who were in Cinco Canyon Gate neighborhood in particular and then some people up and down that have flooded in various places in Katy So[END OF RECORDING] 4
